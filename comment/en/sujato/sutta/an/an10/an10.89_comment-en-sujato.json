  "an10.89:15.3": "The measure here is the _khārika_. A single horse in those days might draw a fully laden cart of around 500 kg. Divide by 20 makes 25 kg, which is roughly a bushel. Elsewhere a _khāri_ is a load carried by a single person on a journey ([dn3:2.4.7](), [ud6.2:2.1](), [ja509:1.3]()), so 25 kg is probably a little much, but in the ballpark. Modern sesame seeds vary between 0.0016 and 0.0037 grams. Assume a single sesamum of 2500 years ago was on the small side of this at 0.002 grams. Taking one every 100 years yields about 25 billion years. The current estimate of the age of the universe in physics is estimated at 13.8 billion years. ",

The commentary offers three explanations for the obscure names of these hells: they are numbers reflecting the duration spent in Avīci; or they are the cries uttered by those suffering there; or they are simply the cold hells.
