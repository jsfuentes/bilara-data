  "an3.84:1.3": "The count of “over a hundred and fifty rules” is found also at [an3.86:1.1](), [an3.87:1.1](), and [an3.88:1.1]()). The Pali _pātimokkha_ has 227 rules, and other Vinayas have similar numbers. Of these, the “Trainings” (_sekhiyas_) are the portion that exhibits by far the most variation between different Vinayas. They deal with matters of etiquette and have no special penalty when broken. The Pali has 75 _sekhiyas_, and if we subtract these from the 227 we are left with 152, thus agreeing with the count in the Suttas. It’s likely, then, that these were not included in the earliest recitation. That does not mean, however, that they were a later invention, for many _sekhiyas_ are found elsewhere in the Suttas and Vinaya. It is, rather, that they were formalized and added to the recitation at a later date. "
