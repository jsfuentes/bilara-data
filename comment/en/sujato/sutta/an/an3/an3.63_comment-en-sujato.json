  "an3.63:3.7": "Legend has it that on the slopes of Mount Meru grows the vast Jambu tree that gives the continent of India her name, “the rose-apple land”. The fruit of that tree are as big as elephants. When they fall their golden juice flows forth as a river, the waters of which solidify as gold nuggets whose unparalleled lustre is highly sought-after among the gods. This is that gold. ",
  "an3.63:6.9": "See BB’s note here. His reading “in such a state” is neither literal nor necessary, and results in the interpretive difficulties he discusses. The phrase evambhuta only seems to occur once elsewhere in the EBTs, at AN 4.11, where BB has not really translated it. However, there it would seem to refer to a monk “like this … “or” of such a sort …”, and so I translate it here. "
