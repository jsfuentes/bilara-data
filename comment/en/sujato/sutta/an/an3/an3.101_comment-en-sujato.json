  "an3.101:1.1": "_Jātarūpa_ here is “native gold”, which is the technical term for naturally occurring gold. Often _jātarūpa_ is simply one of the several Pali words for “gold”, but sometimes, as here, it refers to the natural, unworked gold (see also [an3.70:38.4]()). I believe the term _jātarūpa_ stems from the very common Vedic sense of _rūpa_ as “form” or “manifestation” of the gods. _Jāta_ is what is “born” or what is part of the “natural” order. Thus _jātarūpa_ is the manifestation of divine form in nature. Compare _jātaveda_, the manifestation of divine knowledge in nature in the form of fire. "
