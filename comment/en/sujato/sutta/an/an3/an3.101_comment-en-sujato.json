  "an3.101:1.1": "“Native gold” renders _jātarūpa_. Often this is simply one of the several Pali words for “gold”, but sometimes, as here, it refers to the natural, unworked gold (see also [an3.70:38.4]()). I believe the term _jātaveda_ stems from the very common Vedic sense of _rūpa_ as “form” or “manifestation” of the gods. _Jāta_ is what is “born” or what is part of the “natural” order. Thus _jātarūpa_ is the manifestation of divine form in nature. "
