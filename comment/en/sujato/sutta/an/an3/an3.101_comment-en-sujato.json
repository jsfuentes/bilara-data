  "an3.101:1.1": "_Jātarūpa_ is “native gold”, which is the technical term for naturally occurring gold. Often _jātarūpa_ is simply one of the several Pali words for “gold”, but sometimes, as here, it refers to the natural, unworked gold (see also [an3.70:38.4]()). I believe the term _jātarūpa_ stems from the common Vedic sense of _rūpa_ as “form” or “manifestation” of the gods. _Jāta_ is what is “born” or what is part of the “natural” order. Thus _jātarūpa_ is the manifestation of the divine form (of the sun) in nature. Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 6.4.25 says that when a child is born, the father whispers “speech” in his ear, then feeds him butter and honey with a piece of _jātarūpa_. Thus he brings into his child at birth the wisdom of the Vedas and the divine manifestation. Compare _jātaveda_, which is the divine knowledge brought to mortals in nature in the form of “fire”. "
