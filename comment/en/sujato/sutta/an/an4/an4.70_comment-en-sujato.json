  "an4.70:1.2": "_Brāhmaṇagahapatikā_ means “brahmins and householders” rather than “brahmin householders”. It is a term for the “landed gentry”. A householder is a landowner, not just a lay person. Thus here they come between the royal officials and the general populace. ",
  "an4.70:1.3": "Here, “brahmins and householders” and “people of town and country” are separate groups of people. At [dn5:12.1](), however, the phrase “of both town and country” qualifies each group. Elsewhere the context does not always decide between these two possibilities. Generally the idiom aims at inclusivity, as opposed to DN 5 where the king is consulting the rich and powerful, so I treat them as two separate groups, thus including the common folk. ",
  "an4.70:1.13": "See BB’s note for the absence of dubbala. Curious that this wasn’t corrected here. "
