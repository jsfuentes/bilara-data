  "an5.68:1.9": "The phrase _sati sati āyatane_, a locative absolute, is tricky. Bodhi follows the commentary in taking _āyatana_ in the sense of “reason”, and treats the locative absolute as conditional: “there being a suitable basis”. However this does not readily account for the repeated _sati_, which he takes as the locative present participle from the verb _atthi_ (“being”). Ānandajoti, by contrast, takes the first _sati_ as “being” and the second as “mindfulness”, and treats the absolute construction as temporal: “while there is a basis for mindfulness”. Both accept the commentary’s gloss of _āyatana_ as _kāraṇa_ (“reason, basis”), although this sense of _āyatana_ is rare in the Suttas (but see [sn12.25:14.3]() = [an4.171:5.3]()). Both these read the absolute construction in a limiting sense; but the expression is used here by the Buddha of himself, so it seems odd that this applies in a limiting way. Indeed, the tenor of the whole phrase is not limiting but expansive, as emphasized through the repeated duplicative constructions in a distributive sense: _yassa yassa … tatra tatreva … sati sati_. I therefore take _sati_ as “being” in both cases; the reduplication as aligned with the previous pronouns, emphasizing universality; the locative absolute as causal; and _āyatana_ in its normal sense of “scope, range”.
