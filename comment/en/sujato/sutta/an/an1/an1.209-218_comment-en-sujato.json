  "an1.217:1.1": "“Kassapa the Prince” (Kumārakassapa) was ordained at twenty ([pli-tv-kd1:75.1.1]()). He features in the Pāyāsisutta ([dn23]()), the Vammikasutta ([mn23]()), and his verses are collected in the Theragāthā ([thag2.41]()). His distinction here is apparently in recognition of the elaborate skills displayed in the Pāyāsisutta. Since that sutta begins without mentioning the Buddha, however, it was probably spoken after the Buddha’s passing (see commentary to Vimānavatthu 74), so his addition here must have been later still.
