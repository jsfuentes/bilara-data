  "an2.60:1.1": "The _kiṁpurisa_ (literally, “what man?”) appears as a substitute in the human sacrifice (Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 1.2.3.9, 7.5.2.32, Aitareya Brāhmaṇa 2.8.1). The context here assumes that the lack of regular speech by _kiṁpurisa_ requires explanation. Thus a _kiṁpurisa_ may be a tribal person or aborigine who spoke little or whose speech was incomprehensible. | Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa treats _mānusiṁ vācaṁ_ as “regular speech” in contrast with the divine words of the Vedas (1.1.4.9, 1.7.4.21, 3.2.2.29, 3.5.4.17, 4.6.9.19, 5.4.4.14, 10.5.1.1). ",
  "an2.63:1.1": "Readings include _vacīsaṁsāro_, _vacīsaṁhāro_, and _vacīsaṅkhāro_. _Vacīsaṁsāro_ is found, without recorded variants, in the parallel passage at [an2.63:1.1](). The commentary here glosses with _vacanasañcāro_, while the subcommentary to AN 2.63 has _pavattamānā_, both of which support the dominant reading _vacīsaṁsāro_. Their explanations differ, however as the commentary here explains as spreading rumors from one place to another, while at AN 2.63 it is said to be ongoing arguing. Since the normal meaning of _saṁsāra_ is “endless ongoing”, and since, in both MN and AN, this follows a passage where disputes were supposed to have been settled, perhaps the sense is “continuing to bring up matters that have been settled”.
