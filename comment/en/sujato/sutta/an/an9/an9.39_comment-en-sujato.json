  "an9.39:7.2": "I follow Bodhi’s emended reading _andhamakāsi_ (“blinded Māra”) for this passage (note 1393 of *Numerical Discourses*). | This passage is highly compressed in the PTS edition, which probably represents the manuscripts more exactly. It has been expanded in both Mahāsaṅgīti and BJT editions. MS edition includes _tiṇṇo loke visattikaṁ_ here, which has been improperly added from the final item. All editions omit _tasmiṁ samaye_ (“at that time”) from the formless sections, which start here. Bodhi has included this phrase in his translation, probably restoring the PTS text, but this in unwarranted. Rather, here the relative _yasmiṁ_ is answered by the demonstrative _ayaṁ_, “this”. "
