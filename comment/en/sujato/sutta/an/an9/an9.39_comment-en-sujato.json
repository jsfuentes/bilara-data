  "an9.39:7.2": "I follow Bodhi’s emended reading _andhamakāsi_ (“blinded Māra”) for this passage (note 1393 of *Numerical Discourses*). | Mahāsaṅgīti edition includes _tiṇṇo loke visattikaṁ_ here, which is clearly a mistake and should apply only to the final item. | The formless sections, which start here, omit _tasmiṁ samaye_ (“at that time”).
