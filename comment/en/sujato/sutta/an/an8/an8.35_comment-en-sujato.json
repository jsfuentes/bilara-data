  "an8.35:1.9": "“Settled for less”: readings vary between _hīne vimuttaṁ_ (“released in what is inferior”, per MS) and _hīne ’dhimuttaṁ_ (“resolved upon what is inferior”). This is an example of an ambiguity between _vi + √muc_ (“release”) and _adhi + √muc_ (“resolve”) that is sometimes seen in Pali texts. The subcommentary reads _vimuttaṁ_ and offers two explanations: “‘Released’ (_vimuttaṁ_) means ‘resolved’ (_adhimuttaṁ_); the meaning is slants, slopes, and inclines. Or else ‘released’ means ‘set free’ (_vissaṭṭhaṁ_).” Given that it is clearly accepted in the commentarial tradition, and that it is the more difficult reading, it seems we must accept _vimuttaṁ_ as the correct reading here. But from context, and from the subcommentary, it has the same sense as _adhimutta_, namely, “resolved upon”. This goes some way to explaining the ambiguity between the two words, as they not only have a similar form, but their meanings can overlap too. ",
  "an8.35:2.3": "Notice that they have “seen” the well-to-do brahmins or aristocrats, but have only “heard of” the various deities. "
