  "an8.90:1.2": "“Position of seniority” (_paccekaṭṭhāne_) occurs only in one other place ([pli-tv-pvr7:30.9]()). The commentary explains, “he should not be put in any fan-holding position, etc., or in a position of seniority”. It seems we should read the compound as _pati_ (“towards”) + _ekaṭṭhāna_ (“the first place”). "
