  "mn106:2.2": "This phrase is sometimes translated as if it was joined to the previous. However, the repeated use of _bhikkhave_, the shift from plural to singular, and the independent occurrence of the former portion ([an10.46:6.5]()) all suggest it is a distinct sentence. | As for _bālalāpana_, at [sn22.95:13.2]() we find _bālalāpinī_ in a similar context, which there follows right after the death of the physical body. This suggests that _lāpinī_ there has the sense “lament” which is attested in Sanskrit. _Bālalāpana_ is found at [thig5.2:2.2]() of a beautiful body; see too [ja421:5.3](). In later Sanskrit, _bālalapitaṁ_ is used by Jayarāśi Bhaṭṭa in his Tattvopaplavasiṁha in the sense “prattle of fools”. ",
  "mn106:3.11": "The idioms here are odd. The comm gives an extensive and implausible explanation, which begins by proposing that the sequence of the text be reversed! Etarahi vā āneñjaṁ samāpajjati. Paññāya vā adhimuccatīti ettha etarahi vā paññāya adhimuccati, āneñjaṁ vā samāpajjatīti evaṁ padaparivattanaṁ katvā attho veditabbo. The Chinese at MA 75 has 以慧為解 “liberated by wisdom”, which is surely a more persuasive reading. I suggest there was an old corruption from vimuccati to adhimuccati. See https://discourse.suttacentral.net/t/free-or-confident/2806 ",
  "mn106:3.12": "Unfortunately, samvattanika doesn’t really mean “evolving”. The normal meaning of samvattanika is “leading on, conducive to”, and the point here is that the state of consciousness developed in meditation is conducive to such a rebirth. ",
  "mn106:5.4": "here rupa is neither “matter “nor” sights” but the meditation visions, i.e. what the later tradition called “nimittas”. "
