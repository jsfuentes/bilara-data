  "mn106:2.2": "This phrase is sometimes translated as if it was joined to the previous. However, the repeated use of _bhikkhave_, the shift from plural to singular, and the independent occurrence of the former portion ([an10.46:6.5]()) all suggest it is a distinct sentence. | As for _bālalāpana_, at [sn22.95:13.2]() we find _bālalāpinī_ in a similar context, which there follows right after the death of the physical body. This suggests that _lāpinī_ there has the sense “lament” which is attested in Sanskrit. _Bālalāpana_ is found at [thig5.2:2.2]() of a beautiful body; see too [ja421:5.3](). In later Sanskrit, _bālalapitaṁ_ is used by Jayarāśi Bhaṭṭa in his Tattvopaplavasiṁha in the sense “prattle of fools”. ",
  "mn106:3.11": "The Pali has _paññāya vā adhimuccati_ (“they resolve with wisdom”). This appears to be an old confusion between _adhimuccati_ (“resolves”) and _vimuccati_ (“is freed”). Elsewhere in Pali we find one who is “freed by wisdom” (eg. [sn22.45:1.6]()) but we don’t find _adhimuccati_ used in this way. The commentary accepts the reading _adhimuccati_, but explains it as referring to either the realization of arahantship or the development of the path to arahantship, which agrees with the idea of “freedom”. Finally, the Chinese parallel (MA 75 at T I 542b23) has <span lang='lzh'>解</span>, while the Tibetan parallel in Śamathadeva’s commentary on the Abhidharmakośabhāṣya (D (4094) mngon pa, ju 228a2) has _rnam par grol ba_, both of which appear to translate _vimuccati_.

  "mn106:3.12": "Unfortunately, samvattanika doesn’t really mean “evolving”. The normal meaning of samvattanika is “leading on, conducive to”, and the point here is that the state of consciousness developed in meditation is conducive to such a rebirth. ",
  "mn106:5.4": "here rupa is neither “matter “nor” sights” but the meditation visions, i.e. what the later tradition called “nimittas”. "
