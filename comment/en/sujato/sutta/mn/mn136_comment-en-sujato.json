  "mn136:6.15": "Text here reads _vibhajantassa_, which appears ungrammatical. This phrase is shared with [an6.62:5.8](), which is also a case where a junior monk has made a silly statement. There the Pali has _vibhajissāmi_ (“I will explain”). The commentary does not explicitly comment on this phrase, but it does say that the Buddha thought, “I will make it clear for the mendicant Saṅgha” (_bhikkhusaṅghassa pākaṭaṃ karissāmīti_), which implies that it was reading the future tense.
