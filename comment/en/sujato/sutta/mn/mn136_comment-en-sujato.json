  "mn136:2.2": "This is the only time we meet Potaliputta. His name suggests he hails from the capital of Assaka, variously spelled Potali or Potana ([dn19:36.4]()). | As for Samiddhi, see note on [mn133:1.3](). ",
  "mn136:2.8": "There is indeed no such statement in the Suttas. ",
  "mn136:2.9": "This is the cessation of perception and feelings. ",
  "mn136:2.14": "It is this answer of Samiddhi’s that is criticized below. ",
  "mn136:6.5": "There are several monks named Udāyī and it is not easy to distinguish them. Of of then was known for his stupidity ([an6.29:3.3]()). | _Ummagga_ is from _ummujjati_, just below, “uprising, emergence”. ",
  "mn136:6.15": "Text here reads _vibhajantassa_, which appears ungrammatical. This phrase is shared with [an6.62:5.8](), which is also a case where a junior monk has made a silly statement. There the Pali has _vibhajissāmi_ (“I will explain”). The commentary does not explicitly comment on this phrase, but it does say that the Buddha thought, “I will make it clear for the mendicant Saṅgha” (_bhikkhusaṅghassa pākaṭaṃ karissāmīti_), which implies that it was reading the future tense. Compare the use of future tense in the stock phrase, “Listen and apply your mind well, I will speak” ([mn138:2.2]()). ",
  "mn136:9.1": "Meditation is described in the same way at [dn1:1.31.1](), which is also concerned with it is possible to draw inaccurate inferences from deep meditation. ",
  "mn136:9.4": "The use of _kira_ (“seems”) suggests an appropriate degree of caution when framing a hypothesis. But as we shall see, the theorist does not maintain this. ",
  "mn136:9.5": "Having framed their hypothesis, the theorist presents their observations, with no logical inference. ",
  "mn136:9.7": "Now the theorist commits two logical fallacies. One is the fallacy of hasty generalization: the fact that *some people* who do bad deeds go to hell does not imply that *all people* who do bad deeds go to hell. The second is the post hoc fallacy: the fact that the bad deed was *followed* by rebirth in hell does not imply that the bad deed *caused* rebirth in hell. ",
  "mn136:9.8": "Leaving behind caution and going beyond observation, the theorist now asserts that the results of their reasoning are the truth. | People of contemplative inclination sometimes deprecate logic as inferior to meditative insight. By not exercising the critical skills to evaluate and improve their reasoning, they become especially prone to using poor logic. The brilliance of their meditative experiences is overwhelming, convincing them of the truth of their inferences, which they do not even recognize as inferences. Sutta passages such as this show that the interpretation of meditative experiences must be tempered with clear logic. "
