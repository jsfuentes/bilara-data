  "mn119:4.7": "For “memories and thoughts of the lay life” (_gehasitā sarasaṅkappā_) see [mn125:23.5](), [sn54.8:5.2](). | _Sarasaṅkappā_ is usually translated as a _dvanda_ compound (“memories and thoughts”), but the commentary explains it as _dhāvanasaṅkappā_ (“rushing thoughts”). Support for the _dvanda_ interpretation comes from Sanskrit texts, where we frequently find _smṛtisaṃkalpa_ as either two words (eg. Aitareya Upaniṣad 3.2) or a compound (Nyāyasūtra 4.2.34). "
