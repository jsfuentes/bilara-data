  "mn119:1.1": "This discourse features the same meditation practices found under the “observation of the body” in the Satipaṭṭhānasutta ([mn10]()). ",
  "mn119:2.4": "",
  "mn119:4.7": "For “memories and thoughts tied to lay life” (_gehasitā sarasaṅkappā_) see [mn125:23.5]() and [sn54.8:5.2](). | _Sarasaṅkappā_ is usually translated as a _dvanda_ compound (“memories and thoughts”), but the commentary explains it as _dhāvanasaṅkappā_ (“rushing thoughts”). Support for the _dvanda_ interpretation comes from Sanskrit texts, where we frequently find _smṛtisaṃkalpa_ as either two words (eg. Aitareya Upaniṣad 3.2) or a compound (Nyāyasūtra 4.2.34). ",
  "mn119:4.8": "Each practice leads directly to immersion, reminding us that mindfulness meditation is “the basis of immersion” (_samādhinimitta_, [mn44:12.3]()). ",
  "mn119:6.1": "Obviously this passage is not suggesting that one enters deep meditation while going to the toilet. As per the Gradual Training, such practices form a foundation that prepares the mind for meditation. ",
  "mn119:7.7": "Such meditations, as also the contemplation on death that follow, lead to immersion by ridding the mind of desire. While the subject of meditation is perceived as unpleasant, when the mind is free of desire it gives rise to a pleasure imbued with lightness and freedom, and it is that pleasure that leads to immersion. ",
  "mn119:18.1": "In the Satipaṭṭhānasutta, the practice of absorption is implicit in the contemplation of feelings (as spiritual pleasure), mind (as immersed mind, etc.), and principles (as the awakening factor of immersion), while the four absorptions are mentioned explicitly in the expanded version ([dn22:21.32]()). Here they take an even more central role. ",
  "mn119:18.2": "As a meditator proceeds, their subjective experience of the “body” evolves from tactile sense impressions (_phoṭṭhabba_), to the interior mental experience of bliss and light (_manomayakāya_), to the direct personal realization of highest truth ([mn70:23.2](): _kāyena ceva paramasaccaṁ sacchikaroti_). ",
  "mn119:18.3": "The kneading is the “placing the mind and keeping it connected”, the water is bliss, while the lack of leaking speaks to the contained interiority of the experience. ",
  "mn119:19.3": "The simile emphasizes the water as bliss, while the lack of inflow expresses containment and unification. The water welling up is the rapture, which is the uplifting emotional response to the experience of bliss. ",
  "mn119:20.3": "The meditator is utterly immersed in stillness and bliss. ",
  "mn119:21.3": "The white cloth is the purity and brightness of equanimity. The commentary explains this as a person who has just got out of a bath and sits perfectly dry and content. ",
  "mn119:22.1": "By this, the Buddha is asserting the mindfulness of the body can be considered, not just the first of the four kinds of mindfulness meditation, but encompasses all of them. The body is the arena within which feelings, mind, and principles become apparent. "
