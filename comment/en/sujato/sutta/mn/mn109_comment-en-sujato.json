  "mn109:5.2": "“Desire” (_chanda_) is the fundamental driving force underlying of all manifestations of the aggregates. ",
  "mn109:6.3": "See [mn44:6.3]() and note there. ",
  "mn109:7.4": "This assumes the persistence of a “self” through time. ",
  "mn109:8.7": "That is to say, the term “aggregate” (_khandha_) is a collective term for all instances of this kind of phenomenon. ",
  "mn109:9.1": "While the “root” of all aggregates is desire, the question now is the immediate basis of each particular aggregate. ",
  "mn109:9.7": "In dependent origination, “contact” (_phassa_) is the immediate condition for “feeling” (_vedanā_). This feeling is the primary reactivity of sense experience. ",
  "mn109:9.8": "Feeling and “perception” (_saññā_) are closely connected, since how we feel conditions how we recognize and interpret. While contact directly underlies feeling, perception works so quickly that is can be included as a direct consequence as well. ",
  "mn109:9.9": "Likewise with “choices” (_saṅkhārā_), which are also part of the complex of reactivity that normally take effect immediately. For example, suppose we try eating a berry in the forest. “Contact” with its bitter taste “feels” unpleasant, so we “perceive” it as poisonous, and “choose” to spit it out. ",
  "mn109:9.10": "Normally in dependent origination, it is consciousness that is a condition for name and form. The presentation here assumes their mutual conditioning, as spelled out at [dn15:22.1](). ",
  "mn109:10.8": "That is to say, the “substantialist” view takes the aggregates, or one of them, to be a “substantial reality” that is identified with the self. Such views are created each time we think or attach to the aggregates as a self. ",
  "mn109:11.8": "Since substantialist view is itself a conditioned phenomenon, it can only continue to exist if it is continually reinforced. Without it, like a fire without a constant supply of fuel, it falters and goes out. ",
  "mn109:12.1": "We have met these questions before at [mn13:6.2](). Here they build on the previous section by showing a strategy for how to stop identifying them as the substantial reality underlying the self. ",
