  "mn131:3.2": "To “anticipate” (_paṭikaṅkhe_) is not always bad. A mendicant ought to “anticipate” dangers (_pāṭikaṅkhitabba_, [an4.122:1.1]() = [mn67:14.2]()); Nālaka “anticipates” the arrival of the Buddha (_patikkhaṁ_, [snp3.11:19.4]()); and an arahant “awaits their time” (_kālaṁ kaṅkhati_, [sn2.29:15.4]()). The verse here has a specific application in meditation, which is explained below. ",

  "mn131:4.2": "_Samanvāneti_ is unique in early Pali, but the similar _samānayi_ is found at [dn30:1.33.4]() and [thig12.1:10.2]() in the sense of “reunite, bring together”. “Muster” means both to bring together and to arouse. "
