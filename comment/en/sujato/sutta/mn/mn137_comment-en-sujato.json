  "mn137:13.1": "",
  "mn137:21.1": "The text has a unique teaching of three _satipaṭṭhānas_ (“establishments of mindfulness”). ",
  "mn137:22.4": "In the Pali manuscripts and commentary, the Burmese manuscripts appear to be alone in having the negative form _anattamana_ (“unhappy”). The Chinese parallel, however, supports the negative form (MA 163 at T i 693c29). | The commentarial derivation of _attamana_ as “self-mind” (= _sakamana_, “own-mind”) is unsatisfactory. Read with Sanskrit _āttamanas_ or _ādattamanas_ (“uplifted mind”, “smiling mind”). ",
  "mn137:25.3": "It seems that the text is punning _sārita_ (“driving”) with _sārathi_ (“charioteer”). "
