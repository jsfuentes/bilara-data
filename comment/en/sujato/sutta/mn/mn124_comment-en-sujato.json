  "mn124:2.1": "The phrase _purāṇagihisahāya_ (“old friend from the lay life”) appears only here and at [sn41.9:1.1](). There it is also said of a naked ascetic called Kassapa, which cannot be a coincidence. In that case he, as the former friend of the householder Citta, is the one interrogated, in a discourse set while the Buddha was still alive. The events of the Bakkulasutta happened many decades after the Buddha’s death, so it seems likely Kassapa was introduced as a conventional foil for Bakkula. ",
  "mn124:3.8": "This repetition is found in the PTS and BJT editions, but missing from MS and King of Siam editions. ",
  "mn124:3.10": "According to the commentary, these responses were added by the Elders at the Second Council, a century after the Buddha’s passing, rather than being spoken by Kassapa. This is supported by several considerations. First, the commentators would rather claim something is early, so when they say it was added later it likely comes from a genuine tradition. Second, the refrains are in plural. Third, the refrains, and the statements of Bakkula that they answer, lack the close _-ti_ indicating a direct quote. Fourthly, they continue after the conversation with Kassapa has concluded. ",
  "mn124:9.1": "From a discussion of mental purity, Bakkula proceeds to list a series of details of conduct, most of which are not morally reprehensible, but which are meant to illustrate his extreme commitment to austerity. | Accepting a robe from a householder, as Ānanda did, implies enjoying the spoils of wealthy donors ([mn52:16.2]() = [an11.16:11.2]()). Austere monks wore robes made of cast-off rags. ",
  "mn124:9.2": "Here BB has “worn a robe”, but this seems to be a mistake, as it is not found in the PTS either. it was probably copied carelessly from the dharema here. ",
  "mn124:11-15.4": "I think this is the right meaning, as opposed to BB’s “working on robes”. Cp. Pc 46 "
