  "mn140:1.3": "The Bhaggava clan was descended from the ancient sage Bhagu (Sanskrit Bhṛgu). They received the gift of fire conveyed by Mātariśvan the wind from the god Agni (eg. Rig Veda 1.60.1). In Pali they appear as potters ([mn81:19.3](), [sn1.50:11.2](), [sn2.24:12.2]()), unless they have gone forth ([dn24:1.1.6]()). Archaeologists refer to the strata around the Buddha’s time as the Northern Black Polished Ware culture on account of the distinctive highly glazed polish that was achieved on the pottery of the time. This, together with the production of iron, marked a significant advance in the mastery of fire. Thus potters were no mere humble craftsmen, but leading technological innovators. ",
  "mn140:3.1": "Pukkusāti is one of a group of seven who attained arahantship in the Pure Abode of Aviha ([sn1.50:3.2](), [sn2.24:4.2]()). | Later Buddhist texts share the story that Pukkusāti had been the king of Taxila in Gandhāra, who went forth out of faith upon reading texts of the Dhamma sent by his friend and ally, Bimbisāra (Pali commentary; T 511 at T XIV 779a; T 211 at T IV 580c19; Mūlasarvāstivāda Vinaya 3.2.26, which spells his name _puṣkarasāri_, the same name as the brahmin known in Pali as Pokkharasāti). Whether writing existed at this time is contested, but later Buddhist texts know of a script called _puṣkarasāri_ (Lalitavistara 10, Vaidya 87; Mahāvastu 14, Senart 1.135). This would have been the writing system in the city of Puṣkarāvati, another city in Gandhāra. The details of the Pukkusāti legend are improbable and it is mostly likely an origin myth suggested by the similarity of his name with Puṣkarāvati, authorizing the establishment of the Dhamma in Gandhāra, as well as offering a precedent for the writing down of the Dhamma.
