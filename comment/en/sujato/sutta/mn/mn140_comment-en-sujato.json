  "mn140:1.3": "The Bhaggava clan was descended from the ancient sage Bhagu (Sanskrit Bhṛgu). They received the gift of fire conveyed by Mātariśvan the wind from the god Agni (eg. Rig Veda 1.60.1). In Pali they appear as potters ([mn81:19.3](), [sn1.50:11.2](), [sn2.24:12.2]()), unless they have gone forth ([dn24:1.1.6]()). Archaeologists refer to the strata around the Buddha’s time as the Northern Black Polished Ware culture on account of the distinctive highly glazed polish that was achieved on the pottery of the time. This, together with the production of iron, marked a significant advance in the mastery of fire. Thus potters were no mere humble craftsmen, but leading technological innovators. ",
  "mn140:3.1": "Pukkusāti is one of a group of seven who attained arahantship in the Pure Abode of Aviha ([sn1.50:3.2](), [sn2.24:4.2]()). | Buddhist texts of the middle period—starting a few centuries after the Buddha—share the story that Pukkusāti had been the king of Taxila in Gandhāra, who went forth out of faith upon reading texts of the Dhamma sent by his friend and ally, Bimbisāra (Pali commentary; T 511 at T XIV 779a; T 211 at T IV 580c19; Mūlasarvāstivāda Vinaya 3.2.26, which spells his name _puṣkarasāri_, the same name as the brahmin known in Pali as Pokkharasāti). Texts of this period know of a script called _puṣkarasāri_ (Lalitavistara 10, Vaidya 87; Mahāvastu 14, Senart 1.135). This would have been the writing system in the city of Puṣkarāvati, another city in Gandhāra, the region where the oldest surviving Buddhist manuscripts have been found. The details of the Pukkusāti legend are improbable and it is mostly likely an origin myth suggested by the similarity of his name with Puṣkarāvati, authorizing the establishment of the Dhamma in Gandhāra, as well as offering a precedent for the writing down of the Dhamma.

  "mn140:3.4": "The Buddha addresses Pukkusāti as “mendicant” (_bhikkhu_), implicitly recognizing him as a Buddhist monk, while Pukkusāti uses the respectful familiar form “reverend” (_āvuso_). ",
  "mn140:5.9": "Compare [an2.37:4.2](), where Sāvatthī is said to be in the east (probably from Madhurā). ",
  "mn140:5.14": "Despite his wisdom, Pukkusāti fails to recognize the Buddha. In other cases such failure is a narrative indication of spiritual blindness (Ajātasattu at [dn2:11.2]() and the park keeper at [mn31:3.4]() = [mn128:0.2]() = [pli-tv-kd10:4.2.3]()). ",
  "mn140:6.3": "The Buddha leads by persuading with the Dhamma, rather than by revealing his identity. ",
  "mn140:32.3": "The “brief analysis” here is the summary teaching around which the sutta is developed ([mn140:7.4]()). "
