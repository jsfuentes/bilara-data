  "mn140:1.3": "The Bhaggava clan was descended from the ancient sage Bhagu (Sanskrit Bhṛgu). They received the gift of fire conveyed by Mātariśvan the wind from the god Agni (eg. Rig Veda 1.60.1). In Pali they appear as potters ([mn81:19.3](), [sn1.50:11.2](), [sn2.24:12.2]()), unless they have gone forth ([dn24:1.1.6]()). Archaeologists refer to the strata around the Buddha’s time as the Northern Black Polished Ware culture on account of the distinctive highly glazed polish that was achieved on the pottery of the time. This, together with the production of iron, marked a significant advance in the mastery of fire. Thus potters were no mere humble craftsmen, but leading technological innovators. ",
  "mn140:3.1": "Pukkusāti was the former king of Gandhāra, according to Pali commentaries and Buddhist Sanskrit sources such as the Mūlasarvāstivāda Vinaya. Sanskrit sources call him _puṣkarasāri_, using the same name for the brahmin known in Pali as Pokkharasādi (see note on [mn98:7.3]()). Tradition says went he forth out of his own faith upon reading texts of the Dhamma sent by his friend and ally, Bimbisāra. Whether writing existed at this time is contested, but Bimbisāra’s use of gold sheets would have made an excellent medium. An early Indian script was known as _puṣkarasāri_ (Lalitavistara 10, Vaidya 87; Mahāvastu 14, Senart 1.135). ",
