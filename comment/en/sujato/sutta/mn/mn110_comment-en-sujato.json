  "mn110:3.1": "Vassakāra asks the Buddha the same questions at [an4.187:2.1](), with an interesting example given from the court gossip. ",
  "mn110:4.1": "“Devotion to untrue persons” is said to be a quality of the Jains ([an10.78:1.7]()). _Bhatti_ appears a few times in early Pali, and the Abhidhamma Vibhaṅga gives it as a synonym of _sevanā_, “association” ([vb17:93.2]()). But the early Pali contexts consistently present it in contexts that are more warmly emotionsl than the rather austere “association”, connecting it with words such as “faith” (_saddhā_), ‘fondness” (_pema_), and “love” (([thag5.12:1.3](), [thig15.1:14.1](), [an5.141:5.2]())). ",
  "mn110:6.2": "Where _assadhhamma_ appears in [an10.62:3.1](), it means listening to “untrue teachings”, whereas this phrase shows that here it means “bad qualities”. "
