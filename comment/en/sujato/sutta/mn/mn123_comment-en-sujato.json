  "mn123:2.4": "This is in reference to the Mahāpadānasutta ([dn14]()). But whereas that Sutta emphasizes the “normalcy” (_dhammatā_) of Buddha hood as a recurring cycle down through the eons, this Sutta is devotional, emphasizing Gotama’s personal qualities. ",
  "mn123:2.7": "This a key example of the genre of “amazing stories” (_abbhutadhamma_), one of the nine categories (eg. [mn22:10.2]()), linking this Sutta with the previous ([mn122:20.1]()). This genre is closely connected to Ānanda, so much so that he may be regarded as its originator (eg. [dn1:3.74.2](), [dn15:1.4](), [dn16:3.11.2](), [sn51.22:2.2](), [an4.76:5.5](), etc.). When Ānanda was at a low point, the Buddha turned it around to speak of Ānanda’s amazing qualities ([dn16:5.16.15]() = [an4.129]()). ",
  "mn123:3.2": "The first three items are unique to this Sutta. | Normally in early Pali, the word _bodhisatta_ is reserved for the Buddha-to-be once he has left home and is practicing “intent on awakening” (eg. [mn26:13.1]()). [dn14:1.17.1]() and [an4.127:1.3]() extend the usage back as far as the end of the immediate past life. Here, he is called _bodhisatta_ from the beginning of the immediate past life. ",
  "mn123:6.2": "From here on, the details are the same as [dn14:1.17.1](). Additionally, the details of passing away from heaven and emerging from the womb are also found in [an4.127:1.3](). ",
  "mn123:13.2": "This tragic detail is also mentioned in [ud5.2](). ",
  "mn123:20.2": "SN 47.12 and SN 52.9 make it clear that _āsabhi_ does not refer to the sound of the speech, but to it’s dramatic and imposing nature. "
