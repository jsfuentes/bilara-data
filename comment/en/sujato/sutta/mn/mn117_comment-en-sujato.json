  "mn117:2.1": "The first portion of this Sutta is also at [sn45.28:1.2](). | “Vital condition” is _upanisa_; this is a condition for something that is both necessary and strongly conducive. | “Prerequiste” is _parikkhāra_, the “equipment” or “requirement”. ",
  "mn117:3.4": "While it is possible to obtain immersion outside the context of the Noble Eightfold Path, without all the factors of the path working together it does not result in liberation and hence is not “right” immersion. ",
  "mn117:4.1": "In the Gradual Training, it is hearing the Dhamma that sets you on the path ([mn101:31.1]()). ",
  "mn117:4.3": "It is not just learning by rote, but the ability to make critical distinctions. ",
  "mn117:6.3": "This unique phrase refers to the kind of right view that results in a good rebirth but not liberation. Compare _sāsavaṁ upādāniyaṁ_ (the five grasping aggregates are “accompanied by defilements and prone to being grasped, [sn22.48:2.2]()) and _iddhi sāsavā saupadhikā, ‘no ariyā’ti_ (“psychic powers that are accompanied by defilements and attachments, and are said to be ignoble”, [dn28:18.3]()). | For “partakes of good deeds” (_puññabhāgiyā_), see [an6.63](), where it refers to a rebirth that results from “defilement”. ",
  "mn117:14.2": "_Takka_ (“thinking”) is normally “logic” but here is a synonym of _vitakka_. | _Appanā_ (“planting”) is where a movement enters its goal, as a river the ocean ([sn15.8:2.3]()), or a peg the wood ([mil3.3.13](), for which see also [mn20.3.4]()). | _Byappanā_ is an intensive form that appears only in this definition. | _Abhiniropana_ is likewise a unique term, with the sense of “sinking into” or “embedding”.
