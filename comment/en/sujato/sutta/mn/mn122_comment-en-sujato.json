  "mn122:2.2": "The Sakyans Khemaka, known for his dark skin, and Ghaṭā are otherwise unknown. Their “lodges” (_vihāra_) were, according to the commentary, buildings offered by them for the use of the Saṅgha inside the Banyan Tree Monastery, rather than being their personal homes. ",
  "mn122:2.3": "The fact that they were readily noticeable suggests that the beds were in the open, a detail confirmed by Tibetan parallel. Bedding and furniture were typically property of the Saṅgha, rather than individuals, so it is an offence to leave them in the open where they might be damaged ([pli-tv-bu-vb-pc14](), [pli-tv-bu-vb-pc15]()). ",
  "mn122:2.8": "Some translators (Chalmers, Horner), as well as the Dictionary of Pali Proper Names, take this name as the masculine form _ghaṭāya_, assuming it is compounded with _sakka_; but names are not usually compounded in this way (cf. _khemakassa_ above), and _ghaṭāya_ does not seem to be attested elsewhere. Bodhi and Thanissaro take it as _ghāṭā_, reading it as the masculine agent noun “slayer”; but the genitive form would be _ghāṭassa_, and I cannot find support for the long initial _ā_, as PTS, BJT, MS, and commentary all have _ghaṭāya_ with no variants. Read per text as the feminine genitive _ghaṭā_, suggesting that it was a woman who donated the building. She was perhaps born under the astrological sign known in India as _kumbha_ or _ghaṭa_ (“water-pot”) and in the west as Aquarius. ",

  "mn122:25.6": "here and at MN 137 BB translates vokkamma as “err and turn aside”. But the use at DN 29 shows that it can apply to someone who truns aside from a bad teaching and should be praised for it. ",
