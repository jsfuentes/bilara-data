  "mn121:1.1": "The topic of emptiness does not take the central role in Pali texts that it did in later Buddhism. This is perhaps at least partly due to different doctrinal developments in the early Buddhist schools. Passages that in the Pali mention impermanence, suffering, and not-self, in parallels of the (Mūla)-Sarvāstivāda often include emptiness as well.

  "mn121:3.2": "“I heard and learned this in the presence” (_sammukhā sutaṁ, sammukhā paṭiggahitaṁ_) is the phrase used in the suttas when reporting a teaching heard directly from the Buddha, eg. [sn55.52:5.1](), [sn22.90:9.1](), [mn47:10.7](), etc. ",
  "mn121:3.3": "The same thing is said by Sāriputta at [mn151:2.3](), upon which the Buddha encourages him to reflect on the purity of his almsfood. Before the Second Council, the elder monk Sabbakāmī revealed that it was his main practiced too ([pli-tv-kd22:2.5.9]()). At [thig3.3:2.1](), the bhikkhunī Uttamā claims to practice emptiness meditation. There are several meditations on emptiness. At [mn43:33.1]() = [sn41.7:4.1](), the “release of the heart through emptiness” is a reflection on not-self (see too [thag19.1:27.2]()). "
