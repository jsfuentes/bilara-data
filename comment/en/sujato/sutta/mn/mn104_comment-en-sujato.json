  "mn104:2.1": "When this event is mentioned at [dn29:1.3]() the Buddha is also in the Sakyan lands, but in a mango grove belonging to a group of Sakyans named Vedhaññā. Both texts tell the story of Cunda conveying the news via Ānanda at Sāma, which was presumably near the mango grove. It does seem strange that two distinct discourses are recorded from the same prompt, but then, why shouldn’t the Buddha give more than one teaching on such an important topic? At [dn33:1.6.1]() the Buddha is at Pāvā in the Mallian lands, and the discourse is spoken by Sāriputta there. Given the evident lateness of DN 33, this is a less convincing framework. A parallel to MN 104 (MĀ 196 at T I 752c12) says he was in the Vajjian lands at the time; both Sakya and Vajji border on Mallā. ",

  "mn104:14.4": "samanumajj-only occurs here. Elsewhere in the EBTs, anumajj-meas “stroke, massage”. At Mil 3.3.14, anumajj-is said to be the characteristic of vicara, in the sense of rubbing or massaging or beating a copper pot into shape. Here it must mean “going over and over the issue until it’s sorted”. ",
