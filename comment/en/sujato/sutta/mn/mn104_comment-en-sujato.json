  "mn104:2.1": "When this event is mentioned at [dn29:1.3]() the Buddha is also in the Sakyan lands, but in a mango grove belonging to a group of Sakyans named Vedhaññā. Both texts tell the story of Cunda conveying the news via Ānanda at Sāma, which was presumably near the mango grove. It does seem strange that two distinct discourses are recorded from the same prompt, but then, why shouldn’t the Buddha give more than one teaching on such an important topic? At [dn33:1.6.1]() the Buddha is at Pāvā in the Mallian lands, and the discourse is spoken by Sāriputta there. Given the evident lateness of DN 33, this is a less convincing framework. A parallel to MN 104 (MĀ 196 at T I 752c12) says he was in the Vajjian lands at the time; both Sakya and Vajji border on Mallā. ",
  "mn104:2.4": "A slight on the movement whose signature virtue was non-violence. ",
  "mn104:2.5": "“With broken monument” (_bhinnathupe_) is used only in this context. When a great teacher or leader died, a “monument” was built to keep their memory alive. The breaking of a monument—whether physical or symbolic—was, in a way, truly killing them. ",
  "mn104:3.1": "Cunda took the time to complete his rains residence before conveying the news, reminding us of the speed with which news traveled in those days—slowly. | Apart from the events described here, we hear of Sāma only once ([an6.21]()). The topic there is the decline of the Saṅgha, hinting at a connection with these events. ",
  "mn104:5.2": "Two brahmins have a “difference of opinion” (_nānāvāda_) regarding their path at [dn13:8.8](). ",
  "mn104:5.8": "Just as the “phrasing” of the text is a minor matter at [mn103:7.12](). ",
  "mn104:6.1": "The Buddha is more concerned with the unskillful roots of division than with the surface details. ",
  "mn104:12.3": "These are formal legal proceedings in the Vinaya, explained at [pli-tv-kd14:14.2.1](). ",

  "mn104:14.4": "_Samanumajjati_ occurs only here. The root _majj_ has the general sense “stroke, massage”. Here it means that they should go over and over until it is settled. | _Dhammanetti_ (“the guidelines of the teaching”) is another rare term, occurring elsewhere only in the late canonical [mil6.3.12:7.5](). ",
  "mn104:15.1": "This explanation is out of order. ",
  "mn104:15.2": "Normally issues are settled by consensus, so this applies in cases where consensus cannot be reached. ",
  "mn104:16.5": "The Vinaya operates on good faith, so that the testimony of a clear-headed mendicant is sufficient to clear them from offences in most cases. ",
  "mn104:17.2": "The offenses entailing expulsion for a mendicant are: willingly engaging in sexual intercourse; intentional killing of a human being; theft of something of value; and deliberately making a false claim to exalted spiritual attainments such as awakening or absorption. ",
  "mn104:17.6": "Note the confusion in the tenses of the accusers here. The Pali has plural above, singular here; in the Vinaya it is singular throughout. ",

  "mn104:19.14": "The idiom with nama expresses exasperatied emphasis. "
