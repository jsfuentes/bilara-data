  "mn115:2.1": "_Paṇḍita_ is normally used for a learned scholar, rather than a contemplative “sage”. Pali has many more terms for “a wise person” than does English, and it is not easy to distinguish the senses. “Astute” is meant to convey the sense of one who is observant and of sound judgment. ",

These all focus on cause and effect as it pertains to development of the path. ",
  "mn115:12.2": "A stream-enterer (or above) might unthinkingly act as if something were permanent (etc.), but on reflection they would know right away that this is not the case. ",
