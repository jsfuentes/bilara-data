  "mn139:12.4": "This is not about “translating” the Dhamma wholesale, but about using local terms, as in the U.S. they say “soda” or “pop” in different regions. Compare [pli-tv-kd15:33.1.5](), which is about giving personalized glosses to terms (_sakāya niruttiya_). | _Pāti_ (“cup”) is from the root _√pā_, “to drink”. | _Patta_ (“bowl”), from the same root, is the standard word for a mendicant’s alms bowl. | _Vitta_ (“plate”) is likely of Dravidian or Munda derivation. | _Sarāva_ (“dish”) is a shallow clay dish (Sanskrit _śarāva_, eg. Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 5.1.4.12; Manu 6.56; also in Jain texts). | _Dhāropa_ (“vessel”) is probably a dialectical variant of Sanskrit _dhāraka_, “vessel, receptacle”. | _Poṇa_ (“tureen”) is a “sloped” dish. | _Pisīla_ (“porringer”) is a wooden bowl (Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 2.5.3.6: _piśīle vā pātryau vā_).
