  "mn150:1.2": "We travel with the Buddha to several “villages of the Kosalan brahmins”, but this is the only recorded visit to Nagaravinda. ",
  "mn150:4.1": "This is an unusual framing, as usually the Buddha refers to wanderers of another religion when speaking with mendicants. The parallel simply says “other people” here (SA 280 at T ii 76c8).

  "mn150:4.15": "This is a much higher standard that that implied at [mn142:8.1](). However, the context ios different: there, it is whether offerings will be fruitful, here it is whether they are truly deserving of respect. "
