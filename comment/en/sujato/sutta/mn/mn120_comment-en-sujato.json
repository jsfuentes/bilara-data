  "mn120:2.1": "Here _saṅkhāra_ has the same sense “choice” that it has in dependent origination or the five aggregates. In each case, it is the mental volition that is motivated by morally meaningful forces, either greed, hate, and delusion, or their opposites. | _Upapatti_ is one of several terms in Pali that regularly mean “rebirth”, which include _jāti_, _(abhi)-nibbatti_, _okkanti_, and _punabbhava_.
