  "mn120:2.1": "Here _saṅkhāra_ has the same sense “choice” that it has in dependent origination or the five aggregates. In each case, it is the mental volition that is motivated by morally meaningful forces, either greed, hate, and delusion or their opposites, and which creates results according to that moral force. Often this works unconsciously, as the effects of our choices and deeds manifest with or without our comprehension. Here, someone who understands how _kamma_ works turns it to their advantage by consciously developing an aspiration for a particular desired result. | _Upapatti_ is one of several terms in Pali that regularly mean “rebirth”, such as _jāti_, _(abhi)-nibbatti_, _okkanti_, and _punabbhava_. ",
  "mn120:3.1": "The aspiration alone is not enough. It only works if the person already has the kammic potential to realize their aims. ",
  "mn120:3.3": "See [dn33:3.1.102]() and [an8.35:1.8](). ",
  "mn120:3.5": "“Meditations” here is _vihārā_, literally “abidings”. ",
  "mn120:12.4": "The text does not say what “pervading” (_pharitvā_) means, but presumably it is the “divine meditations” (_brahmavihāra_), which are said to be “spread” or “pervaded” (eg. [mn7:13.1]()). ",
  "mn120:12.12": "This passage seems problematic in light of the usual understanding that rebirth in the Brahmā realms requires the development of absorption. While the wording is a little different, similar passages at [dn33:3.1.134]() and [an8.35:4.7]() also say that those who are generous and ethical may be reborn in a Brahmā realm. "
