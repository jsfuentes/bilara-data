  "mn120:2.1": "Here _saṅkhāra_ has the same sense “choice” that it has in dependent origination or the five aggregates. In each case, it is the mental volition that is motivated by morally meaningful forces, either greed, hate, and delusion or their opposites, and which creates results according to that moral force. Often this works unconsciously, as the effects of our choices and deeds manifest with or without our comprehension. Here, someone who understands how _kamma_ works turns it to their advantage by consciously developing an aspiration for a particular desired result. | _Upapatti_ is one of several terms in Pali that regularly mean “rebirth”, such as _jāti_, _(abhi)-nibbatti_, _okkanti_, and _punabbhava_.

  "mn120:3.5": "“Meditations” here is _vihārā_, literally “abidings”. "
