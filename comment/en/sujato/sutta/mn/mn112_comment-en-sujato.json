  "mn112:6.2": "_Virāgunaṁ_ is a secondary derivation from _virāga_ with the _-una_ suffix. Also found at [iti77:3.2](). | _Rāga_ can mean “color” or “desire”, so its opposite _virāga_ has the dual connotations of “dispassion” and “colorless” or metaphorically “fading away”. Kauṭilya’s Arthaśāstra 2.10.58 gives an example in the context of writing. In those days, the letters would be etched in a palm leaf with a stylus, then “colored” by applying dye or ink. The surface would then be wiped clean, leaving just the ink staining the etched letters. An example of poorly done writing is _virāga_, “colorless”, i.e. the ink does not take hold. "
