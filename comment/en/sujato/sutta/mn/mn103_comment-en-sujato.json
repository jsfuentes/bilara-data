  "mn103:2.2": "_Bhavābhava_ does not mean “existence and non-existence” but is a distributive compound, “this or that state of existence”. Indian religious texts are full of discussions about different heavens and hells. The Buddha teaches for liberation, not rebirth in heaven. ",
  "mn103:10.1": "Punctuation in MS is incorrect: the following iti belongs on this line, as shown in the repetition below. ",
  "mn103:15.1": "Var readings vacisamhara, vacisamsara, vacisankhara: Comm: Vacīsaṁhāroti vacanasañcāro. Imehi kathitaṁ amūsaṁ antaraṁ paveseyya, tumhe imehi idañcidañca vuttāti amūhi kathitaṁ imesaṁ antaraṁ paveseyyāti attho, Tika: Vacanasañcāroti pesuññavasena aññathāvacanupasaṁhāro. The parallel passage is at AN 2.63, where samsara is the MS reading, and adopted by BB there. Comm there gives a completely different explanation: ubhato vacīsaṁsāroti dvīsupi pakkhesu aññamaññaṁ akkosanapaccakkosanavasena saṁsaramānā vācā vacīsaṁsāro. Tika has: Saṁsaramānāti pavattamānā. Despite this, I think the reading samhara makes better sense, as per MN comm. "
