  "mn116:1.1": "This is a devotional Sutta that lists the names of sages of the past. It is recited as a protection chant in Sri Lanka. The Chinese parallel shares only the opening passages, after which it is quite different. Moreover, only three of the names are clearly the same, namely Ariṭṭha, Upariṭṭha, and Sudassana (EA 38.7 at T II 723a–c). | Nyanamoli and Bodhi both rightly note that it is difficult to distinguish names and attributes without the commentary. Yet the commentary leaves many problems unsolved, as it omits to comment on many names, and when it does it is not necessarily infallible. ",
  "mn116:1.2": "Rājagaha is surrounded by an extensive range of hills, upon which ascetics of various kinds could be found striving. ",
  "mn116:3.2": "The concept of the _pacceka_ Buddha_ allows that there were awakened sages before Gotama. It is sometimes said that they do not teach, but the tradition attributes to them a number of sayings (notably [snp1.3]()). They are sometimes said to be “solitary”, but here 500 dwell on the same hill, while _pacceka_ Brahmās appear in pairs ([sn6.6:1.3]()). Compare [pli-tv-bu-vb-np9:1.36.1](), where “independent” funds are set up for “independent” robes (rather than combining them); the same idea occurs at [an11.16:11.2](). Likewise, [sn1.37:1.7]() speaks of “independent” verses. Thus the burden of sense in the Pali is that _pacceka_ means “independent’, which here has the the sense of not forming a fourfold community, but simply living and practicing independently. ",
  "mn116:3.6": "This etymology is a deliberate pun, since the obvious explanation would be that _gili_ is simply _giri_ (“mountain”), as Pali *r* becomes *l* in the Magadhan dialect. This passage is not found in the Chinese parallel. ",
  "mn116:4.1": "An agent of Kuvera has this name (meaning “indestructible”) at [dn32:7.47](), where it is next to Nemi (below at [mn116:6.7]()). Ariṭṭha and Nemi often appear compounded in Sanskrit as Ariṣṭanemi. This was the name of a past Buddha (Mahāvastu 1.140), the 22nd Jain _tīrthaṅkara_ (Kalpasūtra 170–183), and a Brahmanical sage of remarkable power (Mahābhārata 3.182.8c). Ariṣṭanemi Tārkṣya, although a mythical being, was said to have composed Rig Veda 10.178. ",
  "mn116:4.2": "This was the name of Anuruddha in a past life as an ascetic ([thag16.9:19.4]()), although it couldn’t be the same person, since Independent Buddhas are not reborn. It means “son of Ariṭṭha”. ",
  "mn116:4.3": "Also named in [sn3.20](), [ud5.3](), and [ja390](), which makes him somewhat of a celebrity by _paccekabuddha_ standards. His name means “jasmine-crested”. ",
  "mn116:4.4": "“Renowned”. ",
  "mn116:4.5": "“Good-looking”. ",
  "mn116:4.6": "Meaning “one who looks kindly”, this was the favored epithet of King Ashoka. ",
  "mn116:4.7": "Elsewhere known as a nation famed for horses, located around modern Afghanistan (“Kandahar”, [an3.70:28.2]()) and its capital ([dn16:6.28.6]()). It was named after its founder, but he is otherwise not known as a sage. This could be any sage from Gandhāra (eg. Triṣaṣṭiśalākāpuruṣacaritra 10.11.9; see [ja406]()). Below we find several place names, which likewise probably refer to sages from those places. ",
  "mn116:4.8": "Meaning “alms-gatherer”, a Bhāradvāja of this name was a famous monk. ",

  "mn116:6.1": "Sumbha is the name of a country, and this might be a sage from there. There is also a powerful _asura_ named Śumbha. | Subha (“beautiful”), Methula (variant _matula_), and Aṭṭhama (“eighth”) are otherwise unknown. | This verse is omitted in the commentary. ",
  "mn116:6.2": "Assumegha (“tear-cloud”) should perhaps be read _sumegha_, “lovely cloud”, the name of a mountain. | Anīgha (“untroubled”) is otherwise unknown. | Sudāṭha (‘strong-tooth”) and Subāhu (below, “strong-arm”) are unknown as sages, but a lion and tiger of these names are identified with Sāriputta and Moggallāna in a past life ([ja361]()).

  "mn116:6.7": "Nemi (“rim”) was the name of the 22nd Jain _tīrthaṅkara_, where it is an abbreviation of _ariṣṭanemi_ (“indestructible rim”). | Take _so_ here as connective pronoun. ",

  "mn116:6.10": "Aṅga (“limb”) is a kingdom, and is sometimes found as a personal name. | Paṅga may be a variant spelling of Vaṅga, i.e. Bengal. | Guttijita means “guard and conqueror (of the senses)”. ",
  "mn116:6.11": "Passi most obviously means “seer”. But perhaps it could be from the root _passa_ (“side”), making this the 23rd Jain _tīrthaṅkara_ Pārśva, who immediately preceded Mahāvīra. ",
  "mn116:6.12": "Aparājita (“unconquered by another”) is a common name. It was the name of the 16th Jain _tīrthaṅkara_ Śāntinātha in a past life. ",
  "mn116:6.13": "Satthar (“teacher” is used in both Buddhism (usually for the Buddha) and Iainism. Pavattar (“roller-forth”, “proclaimer”) has a similar sense. | Sarabhaṅga (“arrow-breaker”) was a forest hermit in Daṇḍaka. See note at mn56:13.27](). | Lomahaṁsa means “hair raising”. ",
  "mn116:6.14": "Asita (“dark one”) was the name of the sage who attended Siddhattha after his birth ([snp3.11]()), while an Asita Devala also features in [mn93]().

  "mn116:6.16": "The commentary says _tadādhimutto_ is the only name in this line, but I take _tad(ā)_ as a connective pronoun, leaving _adhimutta_ (“faithful”) as the name. Moreover, since the syntax echoes exactly the previous line, I construe it the same way, making _ketumā_ (one who is “adorned with banners” like the sun) a proper name. There are several people and places of this name in Sanskrit, among them at least one sage. I do follow the commentary in taking _vimalo_ as an attribute (“immaculate”), but it could be a proper name, in which case it would be shared with Vimala, the 13th Jain _tīrthaṅkara_. ",
  "mn116:6.17": "Ketumbharāga is “cloud-colored”. | Mātaṅga (“one who goes where they wish”, i.e. “elephant” or perhaps given the context, “cloud”) is the name of an outcast who became a sage in sources both Brahmanical (Skandapurāṇa 5.2.60) and Buddhist ([ja497]()). | A sage named Ariya is found in the Jain Isibhāsiyāiṁ chapter 19, where he teaches a doctrine of “civility”.

  "mn116:6.18": "Accuta (“unfallen”) is a name of Agni (Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 1.6.1.6) and later Viṣṇu/Kṛṣṇa. | If Accuta is Viṣṇu/Kṛṣṇa, perhaps Accutagāma is a garbled form of his elder brother Balarāma’s name Acyutāgraja (“firstborn of the unfallen”). | Byāmaka means “fathom-long”. ",

[ja420]() tells of how a park-keeper named Sumaṅgala accidentally killed a _paccekabuddha_. | Dabbila probably refers to one who uses the sacrificial “ladle” (_darvi_, see [mn93:18.71]() and note). | Supatiṭṭhita (“well-established”) might be an attribute; commentary is silent.

  "mn116:6.21": "Durannaya means “hard to follow”. | Saṅgha (“community”) is a fairly common name in Pali. | Ujjaya (“victory”) in Pali is the name of a brahmin ([an4.39](), [an8.55]()) and a mendicant ([thag1.47]()). The city of Ujjeni in Avantī is sometimes spelled _ujjaya_, so this is perhaps someone from there. ",
  "mn116:6.22": "Sayha is the name of a mountain district in which the Godhāvarī arises (Trimbakeshwar Range). It is south of Ujjeni, so perhaps both of these are places. ",

In her translation, Horner took _athopi uttaro_ in the previous line as “also another” Bhāradvāja, with the other items as attributes. However, the commentary is silent here. I take this as endorsing the default, namely that each term is a name, and so I leave the tension unresolved. There were, after all, many Bhāradvājas. | In Jainism, Keśi is a noted ascetic disciple of Pārśva at Uttarādhyayanasūtra 23.2. ",
