  "mn116:3.2": "The concept of the _pacceka_ Buddha allows that there were awakened sages before Gotama. It is sometimes said that they do not teach, but the tradition records a number of their sayings. They are sometimes said to be “solitary”, but here 500 dwell on the same hill, while _pacceka_ Brahmās appear in pairs ([sn6.6:1.3]()). Compare [pli-tv-bu-vb-np9:1.36.1](), where “independent” funds are set up for “independent” robes (rather than combining them). Likewise, [sn1.37:1.7]() speaks of “independent” verses. ",

  "mn116:6.26": "Not sure why BB takes these as descriptions of Bharadvaja, it sounds unlikely that a paccekabuddha would be described as “with crested mane”!
