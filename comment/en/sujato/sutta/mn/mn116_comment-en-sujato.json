  "mn116:1.1": "This is a devotional Sutta that lists the names of sages of the past. It is recited as a protection chant in Sri Lanka. ",
  "mn116:1.2": "Rājagaha is surrounded by an extensive range of hills, upon which ascetics of various kinds could be found striving. ",
  "mn116:3.2": "The concept of the _pacceka_ Buddha_ allows that there were awakened sages before Gotama. It is sometimes said that they do not teach, but the tradition attributes to them a number of sayings (notably [snp1.3]()). They are sometimes said to be “solitary”, but here 500 dwell on the same hill, while _pacceka_ Brahmās appear in pairs ([sn6.6:1.3]()). Compare [pli-tv-bu-vb-np9:1.36.1](), where “independent” funds are set up for “independent” robes (rather than combining them); the same idea occurs at [an11.16:11.2](). Likewise, [sn1.37:1.7]() speaks of “independent” verses. Thus the burden of sense in the Pali is that _pacceka_ means “independent’, which here has the the sense of not forming a fourfold community, but simply living and practicing independently. ",
  "mn116:3.6": "This etymology is a deliberate pun, since the obvious explanation would be that _gili_ is simply _giri_ (“mountain”), as Pali *r* becomes *l* in the Magadhan dialect. ",
  "mn116:4.1": "An agent of Kuvera has this name (meaning “unimpaired”) at [dn32:7.47](), where it is next to Nemi (below at [mn116:6.7]()). Ariṭṭha and Nemi often appear compounded in Sanskrit, Ariṣṭanemi. This was the name of a past Buddha (Mahāvastu 1.140), the 22nd of the Jain _tīrthaṅkaras_ (Kalpasūtra 170–183), and of a Brahmanical sage of remarkable power (Mahābhārata 3.182.8c). Ariṣṭanemi Tārkṣya, although a mythical being, was said to have composed Rig Veda 10.178. ",
  "mn116:4.2": "This was the name of Anuruddha in a past life as an ascetic ([thag16.9:19.4]()), although it couldn’t be the same person, since Independent Buddhas are not reborn. It means “son of Ariṭṭha”. ",
  "mn116:4.3": "Also named in [sn3.20](), [ud5.3](), and [ja390](), which makes him somewhat of a celebrity by _paccekabuddha_ standards. His name means “Jasmine-Crested”. ",
  "mn116:4.4": "“Renowned”. ",
  "mn116:4.5": "Meaning “good-looking”, this is a common name in Pali and Sanskrit. ",
  "mn116:4.6": "Meaning “one who looks kindly”, this was the favored epithet of King Ashoka. ",
  "mn116:4.7": "Elsewhere known as a nation famed for horses, located around modern Afghanistan (“Kandahar”, [an3.70:28.2]()) and its capital ([dn16:6.28.6]()). It was named after its founder, but he is otherwise not known as a sage. This could be any sage from Gandhāra (eg. Triṣaṣṭiśalākāpuruṣacaritra 10.11.9; see [ja406]()). ",
  "mn116:6.23": "The commentary says there were four of each, twelve in total. ",
  "mn116:6.26": "Not sure why BB takes these as descriptions of Bharadvaja, it sounds unlikely that a paccekabuddha would be described as “with crested mane”! Comm is silent here, which I take as endorsing the default, i.e. a straight list of names. | Keśi is a noted ascetic disciple of Pārśva at Uttaradhyayana 23.2 ",
  "mn116:6.36": "",
  "mn116:7.1": "I count 103 named sages in total. However, the number is not certain, as it is not always possible to distinguish between proper names and descriptive epithets. "
