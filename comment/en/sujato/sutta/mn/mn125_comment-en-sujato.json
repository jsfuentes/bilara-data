  "mn125:1.1": "This discourse uses the training of an elephant as an extended allegory for the Gradual Training. ",
  "mn125:2.2": "Jayasena features in this discourse and the next. The commentary says he was Bimbisāra’s son. | Aciravata is otherwise unknown. ",
  "mn125:2.4": "Saccaka is also called Aggivessana ([mn35:4.2]()). ",
  "mn125:7.2": "The Buddha has encouraging words for his student, not letting him blame himself for Jayasena’s rejection. ",
  "mn125:7.3": "A parallel passage occurs at [mn125:7.3](), where the phrases “dwells in the midst of sensual pleasures, enjoying them” are reversed. The sequence there makes better sense: it starts with where they are, then what they enjoy, and gradually moves up to being consumed and seeking more. I take this as the correct sense and translate both passages accordingly. ",
  "mn125:9.1": "This simile is contextual, as Rājagaha is indeed surrounded by mountains. ",
  "mn125:9.2": "For _hatthavilaṅghaka_ (“lending a hand up”) see [mn31:9.7](). ",
  "mn125:11.1": "",
  "mn125:13.1": "The parallel at MA 198 is considerably simpler, mentioning only purity of body, speech, and mind, undertaking mindfulness meditation, and entering the four absorptions. ",
  "mn125:24.2": "See note by BB, and Analayo’s discussion in Comparative Studies. Manuscripts, including Skt and Chinese, seem to vary between kayupasamhita … dhammupasamhita, and kamupasamhita. Evidently the entire passage is corrupt, and I don’t see that a definitive conclusion is attainable. It seems to me the simplest explanation of the situation in the Pali text is that the above fragment on giving up the five hindrances was accidentally added as part of the abbreviated gradual training section. With that removed, kamupasamhita becomes the more obvious reading here. "
