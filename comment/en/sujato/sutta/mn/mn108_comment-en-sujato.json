  "mn108:2.1": "As to the politics of the situation, Pajjota had established a formidable set of alliances by marriage. He took to wife Śivā, daughter of Ceṭaka of the Licchavīs. Prince Bodhi of the Bhaggas was Pajjota’s grandson, since Bodhi’s father was Udena, king of Kosambi, while his mother was Vāsuladattā, daughter of Pajjota ([mn85:2.1]()). Meanwhile, Subāhu of Madhurā had married the sister of Pajjota ([mn84:2.1]()). He therefore had allies in Avanti, Bhagga, Vaccha, and Sūrasena, all nations to the west of Magadha, as well as Vajjī, against which Magadha was preparing war to the north. He was formerly a friend of Magadha as well. The Vinaya tells of when Pajjota fell ill and was treated by Jīvaka, the doctor of the Buddha and of Ajātasattu’s father Bimbisāra ([pli-tv-kd8:1.23.1]()). Jīvaka, knowing Pajjota would dislike it, fled after administering the cure because he was “fierce” (_caṇḍa_, [pli-tv-kd8:1.24.11]()). But when the medicine worked, he favored Jīvaka with a gift of fine cloth. Pajjota, who was known for the power of his elephants, was therefore a friend of Bimbisāra. It seems he was moved to anger against Ajātasattu, who had murdered Bimbisāra and was threatening his allies in Vajjī. However, we do not hear that any direct conflict flared up at that time. Roughly half a century later, the matter was settled when the Licchavī Śiśunāga, having usurped the throne of Magadha from the Haryanka dynasty founded by Bimbisāra, conquered Avanti, Kosala, and Vaccha.
