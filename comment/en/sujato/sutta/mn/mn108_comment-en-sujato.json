  "mn108:2.1": "Pajjota had established a formidable set of alliances by marriage. He took to wife Śivā, daughter of Ceṭaka of the Licchavīs. Prince Bodhi of the Bhaggas was Pajjota’s grandson via his mother Vāsuladattā, queen of the powerful King Udena of Kosambi ([mn85:2.1]()). Meanwhile, Subāhu of Madhurā had married Pajjota’s sister ([mn84:2.1]()). Pajjota therefore had allies in Avanti, Bhagga, Vaccha, and Sūrasena, all nations to the west of Magadha, as well as Vajjī, against which Magadha was preparing war to the north. He was friendly with Ajātasattu’s father Bimbisāra of Magadha as well. The Vinaya relates how Pajjota’s illness was treated by Jīvaka, the doctor of the Buddha and of Bimbisāra ([pli-tv-kd8:1.23.1]()). Jīvaka, knowing Pajjota would dislike the medicine, escaped his wrath by fleeing after administering the cure. But when the cure worked, Pajjota favored Jīvaka with a gift of fine cloth. Ajātasattu subsequently murdered Bimbisāra and threatened Pajjota’s allies in Vajjī. Racked by guilt, Ajātasattu saw enemies on all sides; he was even afraid of mendicants meditating in a hall ([dn2:10.8]()). His fear of Pajjota was not idle, for Pajjota was known for the power of his elephants as much as for his wrath. However, we do not hear that any direct conflict flared up at that time. jātasattu. Roughly half a century later, the matter was settled when the Licchavī Śiśunāga, having usurped the throne of Magadha from the Haryaṅka dynasty founded by Bimbisāra, conquered Avanti, Kosala, and Vaccha. ",
  "mn108:5.3": "This links back to the Buddha’s claim in the previous sutta that he is the one who shows the way ([mn107:14.28]()). ",
  "mn108:6.2": "Vassakāra must have returned from building Pāṭaliputta to the north on the Ganges, which would eventually become the capital of the expanded Magadhan empire ([dn16:1.26.1]()). | Rājagaha is surrounded by hills, on which remnants of ancient fortifications can be seen. ",
  "mn108:7.2": "Accept reading _paṭidhāveyyāthāti_ (BJT, PTS, Siamese and Khmer editions) against Mahāsaṅgīti’s _paṭipādeyyāthāti_. For this term, see [mn38:23.4]() and note there, and [sn12.20:5.1](). ",
  "mn108:7.3": "The Buddha made this clear to Ānanda shortly before his death ([dn16:2.24.4]()). ",
  "mn108:8.1": "The Vinaya sets up procedures whereby the Saṅgha can appoint officials to carry out necessary duties. For example, a monk might be in charge of assigning dwellings ([pli-tv-bu-vb-ss8:1.1.1]()) or teaching the novices ([pli-tv-kd16:21.3.30]()). Such officials have authority within the roles prescribed to them under the Vinaya as implemented by the Saṅgha. However, they have no special authority outside of that role, and there is no provision for a general role of authority over the Saṅgha as a whole. The Saṅgha followed this precedent at the First Council, where Ānanda was appointed to recite the Suttas, and Upāli to recite the Vinaya. Mahākassapa led the proceedings, but decisions were made by the Saṅgha in consensus. ",
  "mn108:9.4": "As explained to Ānanda at [dn16:4.7.3](). ",
  "mn108:10.14": "The Suttas note “over a hundred and fifty rules” ([an3.84:1.3](), [an3.86:1.1](), [an3.87:1.1](), [an3.88:1.1]()). The Pali _pātimokkha_ has 227 rules, and other Vinayas have similar numbers. Of these, the “Trainings” (_sekhiyas_) are the portion that exhibits by far the most variation between different Vinayas. They deal with matters of etiquette and have no special penalty when broken. The Pali has 75 _sekhiyas_, and if we subtract these from the 227 we are left with 152, thus agreeing with the count in the Suttas. It’s likely, then, that these were not included in the earliest recitation. That does not mean, however, that they were a later invention, for many _sekhiyas_ are found elsewhere in the Suttas and Vinaya. It is, rather, that they were formalized and added to the recitation at a later date. ",
  "mn108:11.2": "Following the PTS reading. rather curiously, neither here nor there is there a mention of any variant. ",
  "mn108:24.2": "BB reads this following PTS, with the following passage a continuation by Vassakara. But that means there is no response by the general. Surely it reads better as in MS edition. Note that just below, taggha starts a new speaker. "
