  "mn108:2.1": "Pajjota had established a formidable set of alliances by marriage. He took to wife Śivā, daughter of Ceṭaka of the Licchavīs. Prince Bodhi of the Bhaggas was Pajjota’s grandson via his mother Vāsuladattā, queen of the powerful King Udena of Kosambi ([mn85:2.1]()). Meanwhile, Subāhu of Madhurā had married Pajjota’s sister ([mn84:2.1]()). Pajjota therefore had allies in Avanti, Bhagga, Vaccha, and Sūrasena, all nations to the west of Magadha, as well as Vajjī, against which Magadha was preparing war to the north. He was friendly with Ajātasattu’s father Bimbisāra of Magadha as well. The Vinaya relates how Pajjota’s illness was treated by Jīvaka, the doctor of the Buddha and of Bimbisāra ([pli-tv-kd8:1.23.1]()). Jīvaka, knowing Pajjota would dislike the medicine, escaped his wrath by fleeing after administering the cure. But when the cure worked, Pajjota favored Jīvaka with a gift of fine cloth. Ajātasattu subsequently murdered Bimbisāra and threatened Pajjota’s allies in Vajjī. So Ajātasattu feared Pajjota, and not idly, for Pajjota was known for the power of his elephants as much as for his wrath. However, we do not hear that any direct conflict flared up at that time. Roughly half a century later, the matter was settled when the Licchavī Śiśunāga, having usurped the throne of Magadha from the Haryaṅka dynasty founded by Bimbisāra, conquered Avanti, Kosala, and Vaccha.

  "mn108:24.2": "BB reads this following PTS, with the following passage a continuation by Vassakara. But that means there is no response by the general. Surely it reads better as in MS edition. Note that just below, taggha starts a new speaker. "
