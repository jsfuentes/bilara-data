  "mn118:1.1": "Mindfulness of breathing is taught partially in the Satipaṭṭhāna Sutta ([mn10:4.3]() = [dn22:2.3]()) and the Kāyagatāsatisutta ([mn119:4.2]()), and fully in the Rāhulovādasutta ([mn62:24.3]()), the Girimānandasutta ([an10.60]()), and throughout the relevant Saṁyutta ([sn54.1]() ff.); it is also in the Vinaya ([pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:1.3.6]()) and in the quasi-Abhidhamma text Paṭisambhidāmagga ([ps1.3:60.3]()). It is regarded in the tradition as the method practiced by the Buddha himself, and has remained the most popular and universal meditation to this day, both in Buddhism and generally. ",
  "mn118:1.3": "The similar list of great disciples is found at [ud1.5:1.3](), where the Buddha described them as true brahmins. ",
  "mn118:2.1": "This reminds us that what is recorded in the Suttas is not the totality of what was taught. There are several instances where more personal meditation instructions are given (eg. [an9.3]()), and this must have been ongoing. ",
  "mn118:3.1": "This was the end of the rains retreat, during which mendicants stayed in one place. To conclude the retreat, the mendicants gather to invite admonition from each other, clearing the air from any conflicts or tension that might have arisen during the retreat. This is done instead of the regular recitation of the Pātimokkha rules. Discussed in detail at [pli-tv-kd4](). ",
  "mn118:4.4": "The rainy season (_vassa_) is four months, of which the rains retreat (_vassāvāsa_) is normally the first three. When the retreat is finished, mendicants usually stay in the monastery for a while to complete the _kaṭhina_ ([pli-tv-kd7]()), repair their robes, and otherwise make preparations for wandering. During this time, it was customary for mendicants who had spent the rains elsewhere to visit Sāvatthī to see the Buddha ([pli-tv-kd4:1.8.1](), [pli-tv-bu-vb-pj4:1.2.1](), [pli-tv-bu-vb-pc8:1.2.1]()). The Komudī marks the end of the rainy season, one month after the rains retreat. "
