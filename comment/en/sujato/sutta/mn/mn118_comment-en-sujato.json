  "mn118:1.1": "Mindfulness of breathing is taught partially in the Satipaṭṭhāna Sutta ([mn10:4.3]() = [dn22:2.3]()) and the Kāyagatāsatisutta ([mn119:4.2]()), and fully in the Rāhulovādasutta ([mn62:24.3]()), the Girimānandasutta ([an10.60]()), and throughout the relevant Saṁyutta ([sn54.1]() ff.); it is also in the Vinaya ([pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:1.3.6]()) and in the quasi-Abhidhamma text Paṭisambhidāmagga ([ps1.3:60.3]()). It is regarded in the tradition as the method practiced by the Buddha himself, and has remained the most popular and universal meditation to this day, both in Buddhism and generally. ",
  "mn118:1.3": "The similar list of great disciples is found at [ud1.5:1.3](), where the Buddha described them as true brahmins. ",
  "mn118:2.1": "This reminds us that what is recorded in the Suttas is not the totality of what was taught. There are several instances where more personal meditation instructions are given (eg. [an9.3]()), and this must have been ongoing. ",
  "mn118:3.1": "This was the end of the rains retreat, during which mendicants stayed in one place. To conclude the retreat, the mendicants gather to invite admonition from each other, clearing the air from any conflicts or tension that might have arisen during the retreat. This is done instead of the regular recitation of the Pātimokkha rules. Discussed in detail at [pli-tv-kd4](). ",
  "mn118:4.4": "The “fourth month” of the rainy season (_vassa_), of which the rains retreat (_vassāvāsa_) is normally the first three. When the retreat is finished, mendicants usually stay in the monastery for a while to complete the _kaṭhina_ ([pli-tv-kd7]()), repair their robes, and otherwise make preparations for wandering. During this time, it was customary for mendicants who had spent the rains elsewhere to visit Sāvatthī to see the Buddha ([pli-tv-kd4:1.8.1](), [pli-tv-bu-vb-pj4:1.2.1](), [pli-tv-bu-vb-pc8:1.2.1]()). The Komudī marks the end of the rainy season, one month after the rains retreat. ",
  "mn118:7.2": "A similar passage is found at [an4.190](). ",
  "mn118:17.1": "The situation here—a mendicant gone to the forest—establishes that this practice takes place in the wider context of the Gradual Training. Indeed, this whole sutta can be understood as an expansion of this phrase, mentioned briefly at [dn2:67.3](). ",
  "mn118:17.2": "The most fundamental meditation instruction. Notice how the Buddha phrases it: not “concentrate on the breath” as an object, but rather “breathing” as an activity to which one brings mindfulness. The stages of breath meditation are not meant to be done deliberately, but to be observed and understood as the natural process of deepening meditation. ",
  "mn118:18.1": "In the beginning, the breath is somewhat rough and coarse. The Pali idiom is “long” and “short” breath, but in English we usually say to breathe “heavily” or “lightly”. ",
  "mn118:18.2": "Over time, the breath becomes more subtle and soft. ",
  "mn118:18.3": "Contextually the idiom “whole body” (_sabbakāya_) here refers to the breath, marking the fuller and more continuous awareness that arises with tranquility. Some practitioners, however, interpret it as the “whole physical body”, broadening awareness to encompass the movement and settling of energies throughout the body. ",
  "mn118:18.4": "The “physical process” (_kāyasaṅkhāraṁ_) is the breath itself ([sn41.6:1.8]()). This can become so soft as to be imperceptible. ",
  "mn118:19.1": "“Rapture” (_pīti_) is an joyous emotional response to pleasure, usually a spiritual sense of elevation or uplift in meditation. Normally rapture is said to arise before tranquility as part of the process leading towards absorption ([mn40:8.2]()). In mindfulness of breathing, however, the body typically becomes quite tranquil before rapture arises. ",
  "mn118:19.2": "The uplifting quality of rapture becomes sublimated to a more subtle, pervasive pleasure or bliss. The meditator refines and stabilizes these positive emotions in their journey towards absorption, which occurs when all necessary factors are fully developed and perfectly balanced in a subtle union. ",
  "mn118:19.3": "“Mental processes” are said to be “perception and feeling” ([mn44:14.1](), [sn41.6:1.7]()). This includes rapture and bliss. “Perception” in meditation also includes the “light” ([mn128:28.2]()) or “forms” ([mn77:23.14]()) often experienced by meditators at this point. Later meditation texts call this a _nimitta_, a “sign” that the mind is becoming subtle and the hindrances quiet as the meditator nears absorption. ",
  "mn118:19.4": "A paradox of meditation is that the stronger things are, the more subtle they become. In the initial stages of practice, it is common to have overwhelming experiences of rapture, with tears of joy, or dramatic and striking “visions”. Inexperienced meditators often believe this signifies a profound realization. With patient mindfulness, however, the feelings and perceptions settle down and become unified, so they are no longer experienced as separate things. Just as the physical breath virtually disappeared, here too the feelings and perceptions can become so subtle as to feel like the simple, normal state of the mind. ",
  "mn118:20.1": "With the stilling of “mental processes”, the mind itself becomes clear, the center of awareness that knows all of this. "
