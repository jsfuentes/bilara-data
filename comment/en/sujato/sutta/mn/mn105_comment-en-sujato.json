  "mn105:2.1": "Also at [sn12.70:4.1](), which concerns the dubious ordination of the wanderer Susīma. | “Enlightenment” is _aññā_, a technical term that refers to the knowledge of perfection (_arahattā_). | A Buddhist mendicant incurs a penalty of expulsion if they deliberately lay false claim to awakening ([pli-tv-bu-vb-pj4]()), and a penalty of confession if they truthfully claim awakening to someone who is not ordained ([pli-tv-bu-vb-pc8]()). These rules directly concern laying claim regarding oneself, but the background stories apply when making claims with regards to another. Mendicants may declare their attainments among the community of monks and nuns who are fully ordained. Typically such a solemn matter is spoken of in a formal and respectful manner with one’s teacher. ",
  "mn105:2.3": "This is apparently Sunakkhatta’s first meeting with the Buddha. In [dn6:5.3]() we learn that, after being ordained three years, he spoke of his limited success in meditation. [mn12]() and [dn24]() deal with his bitter criticisms of the Buddha shortly after his disrobal. ",
  "mn105:4.5": "By a loophole in the wording of the Vinaya, it is not an offence to tell anyone of your attainments if you are genuinely deluded and falsely believe that you have an attainment that you do not have. The Buddha dismissed such “overestimation” (_adhimāna_) as “negligible” ([pli-tv-bu-vb-pj4:2.1]()). ",

  "mn105:5.11": "That is, if they plan to trap the Buddha with sophistry, he realizes that they are not ready to be taught. ",
  "mn105:8.3": "The “imperturbable” refers to high meditative attainments, typically the fourth absorption and above. ",
  "mn105:9.12": "The reading _āneñjasaṁyojanena hi kho visaṁyutto_ is problematic, as it suggests they are free of the fetter of the imperturbable, which would mean they are an arahant. Several manuscripts omit this phrase, but it is glossed in the commentary. I think it harks back to the immediately prior _āneñjapaṭisaṁyuttāya_; possibly the _paṭi_ dropped out in an old misreading. They’re not detached from the “fetter” of the imperturbable, but from “what is connected with” the imperturbable, i.e. they are disinterested in the talk about it. ",
  "mn105:11.2": "Here and in the following examples, the verb in the explanation follows the metaphor: a leaf is “dropped”, a stone is “broken”, etc. ",
  "mn105:12.2": "This case and the next would apply to the Buddha’s former teachers, who taught the dimensions of nothingness and neither perception nor non-perception respectively ([mn26:15.1]()). ",
  "mn105:12.3": "In this case, the “imperturbable” must refer to the fourth absorption and the first two formless attainments. ",
