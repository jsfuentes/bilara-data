  "mn105:2.1": "Also at [sn12.70:4.1](), which concerns the dubious ordination of the wanderer Susīma. | “Enlightenment” is _aññā_, a technical term that refers to the knowledge of perfection (_arahattā_). | A Buddhist mendicant incurs a penalty of expulsion if they deliberately lay false claim to awakening ([pli-tv-bu-vb-pj4]()), and a penalty of confession if they truthfully claim awakening to someone who is not ordained ([pli-tv-bu-vb-pc8]()). These rules directly concern laying claim regarding oneself, but the background stories apply when making claims with regards to another. Mendicants may declare their attainments among the community of monks and nuns who are fully ordained. Typically such a solemn matter is spoken of in a formal and respectful manner with one’s teacher. ",
  "mn105:2.3": "This is apparently Sunakkhatta’s first meeting with the Buddha. In [dn6:5.3]() we learn that, after being ordained three years, he spoke of his limited success in meditation. [mn12]() and [dn24]() deal with his bitter criticisms of the Buddha shortly after his disrobal. ",
  "mn105:4.5": "By a loophole in the wording of the Vinaya, it is not an offence to tell anyone of your attainments if you are genuinely deluded and falsely believe that you have an attainment that you do not have. The Buddha dismissed such cases of “overestimation” (_adhimāna_) as “negligible” ([pli-tv-bu-vb-pj4:2.1]()). ",

  "mn105:9.12": "The reading is problematic, and BB follows several manuscripts in omitting āneñjasaṁyojanena hi kho visaṁyutto. However, as the MS notes, it is commented on: Āneñjasaṁyojanena hi kho visaṁyuttoti āneñjasamāpattisaṁyojanena visaṁsaṭṭho. But the idea that such a person is genuinely detached from the anenja cannot be right. I suspect there was an old confused reading, and that this line connects back to the immediately prior anenjapatisamyutta. i.e. they’re not detached from the “fetter” of the anenja, but from “what is connected with” the anenja, i.e. the talk, etc. as discussed earlier.
