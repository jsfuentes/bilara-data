  "mn105:4.5": "Normally _kacci te_ idioms have a sense of “I hope that” or “I trust that”. Here, I think this is justified by the non-standard way the “or” idiom is applied; i.e. it’s not just a straight “va” construction. ",

  "mn105:9.12": "The reading is problematic, and BB follows several manuscripts in omitting āneñjasaṁyojanena hi kho visaṁyutto. However, as the MS notes, it is commented on: Āneñjasaṁyojanena hi kho visaṁyuttoti āneñjasamāpattisaṁyojanena visaṁsaṭṭho. But the idea that such a person is genuinely detached from the anenja cannot be right. I suspect there was an old confused reading, and that this line connects back to the immediately prior anenjapatisamyutta. i.e. they’re not detached from the “fetter” of the anenja, but from “what is connected with” the anenja, i.e. the talk, etc. as discussed earlier.
