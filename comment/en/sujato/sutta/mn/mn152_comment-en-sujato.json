  "mn152:1.2": "The names here are spelled _gajaṅgalā_ and _suveḷuvana_, but I keep consistency with [an10.28](), where a nun residing at this town gives a penetrative discourse to the townsfolk. In the Vinaya it is mentioned as the easternmost point of the “middle country”, just beyond which lay Mahāsāla ([pli-tv-kd5:13.12.2]()). The Milindapañha says it was a brahmin village on the slopes of the Himalayas where its main protagonist, the monk Naāgasena, was born ([mil2:22.3]()). Assuming both these are the same place, we might look somewhere near Darjeeling for this town. In any case, it represents the furthest east that the Buddha taught. It is sometimes identified with <span lang='lzh'>羯蠅揭羅</span> mentioned by Xuang Zang, but that has been located near Agra south of Sāvatthī. ",
  "mn152:2.1": "A brahmin teacher named Pārāsariya (also spelled Pārāpariya or Pārāsiviya) features in [ja222]() and [ja353]() as one who warns that doing evil will lead to regret. The three similarly-named monks in the Theragāthā ([thag1.116](), [thag16.2](), [thag16.10]()) share the same clan name (Sanskrit Pārāśarya). These are descendants of the great sage Parāśara Śāktya, who is mentioned in Rig Veda 7.1.18 alongside Śatayātu, Vasiṣṭha; his prayers to Agni are recorded at Rig Veda 1.65–73, and to Soma at 9.97.31–44.
