  "mn129:34.2": "The wheel is firstly the sun and secondly the wheel of the chariots that drove the Indo-Europeans in their conquests. It is the manifestation of unstoppable power. The whole story reflects the Indo-European dream of universal domination. | Compare [dn17:1.7.3]() and [dn26](). ",
  "mn129:35.1": "Many of the details in this myth echo the Brahmanical horse sacrifice. Since the horse was the primary source of Indo-European dominion, its sacrifice served to authorize the power of a king. It was a costly and dangerous rite that was attempted only by the greatest of sovereigns. | _Bhiṅkāra_ (“ceremonial vase”) and _abbhukkirati_ (“besprinkled”) are elevated terms. ",
  "mn129:35.3": "In the horse sacrifice, the horse is released for a year, while the king follows it with his army, claiming any land that it wanders on as his. ",

But compare the archaic English “use” meaning “the benefit or profit of lands”. Thus _yathābhuttañca bhuñjatha_ means “use as has been used”, i.e. “maintain the current level of taxation”. ",

  "mn129:40.2": "Interesting that hidden treasure was a significant part of the national budget! ",
  "mn129:45.1": "_Brāhmaṇagahapatikā_ means “brahmins and householders” rather than “brahmin householders”. It is a term for the “landed gentry”. A householder is a landowner, not just a lay person. Here the king is beloved of the upper class rather than the general populace (_negamajānapadā_). "
