  "mn146:1.1": "This discourse deals with the fortnightly teaching of the nuns, a practice ostensibly set up at Mahāpajāpati’s ordination ([an8.51:13.1](), [pli-tv-kd20:1.4.7]()) and mandated in the Vinaya ([pli-tv-bu-vb-pc21](), [pli-tv-bi-vb-pc59]()). This is the only mention of such a teaching in the discourses. However it does not follow the pattern laid out in the Vinaya, where the teaching consists of the eight _garudhammas_ ([pli-tv-bi-vb-pc58]()), and the monks cannot go to the nuns’ monastery to advise them ([pli-tv-bu-vb-pc23]()). ",
  "mn146:2.1": "Here we see Mahāpajāpati in the leadership role that would be expected were she the founder of the nuns. However, this is the only case where this occurs. ",
  "mn146:3.1": "Monks must be appointed by the Saṅgha to take on this role, and they must fulfill eight factors [pli-tv-bu-vb-pc21](): they must be virtuous and learned, have memorized both Monastic Codes, be well-spoken, liked by the nuns, and capable, never having committed a heavy offense against a nun; and they must have been ordained at least twenty years. ",
  "mn146:3.2": "Nandaka was praised for his teaching of monks ([an9.4]()). At [an3.66]() he taught the layman Sāḷha how to discern the true teaching, using the method of questioning as he does in the present discourse. His four Theragāthā verses are at [thag4.4]() according to the commentary. A second Nandaka is at [thag2.27](); he was the brother of Bharata [thag2.28](). | While the text does not explain why he was reluctant to teach, the commentary says that those nuns were his wives in past lives, and he wanted to avoid the potential for gossip. ",
  "mn146:4.6": "The Royal Monastery (_rājakārāma_) was a residence for nuns near Sāvatthī, also featured in [sn55.11](). ",
  "mn146:5.4": "Nandaka is not interested in lecturing the nuns, but in engaging with them. He makes it clear that, against patriarchal expectations, the nuns should ask for clarifications. ",
  "mn146:5.5": "Thus fulfilling one of the factors required for a teacher of nuns. ",
  "mn146:6.2": "The discussion begins with the most obvious factors, the internal sense organs, and proceeds to analyze each in terms of the three characteristics: impermanence, suffering, and not-self. Nandaka ensures that the nuns are with him each step. ",
  "mn146:9.1": "While the imagery of the dependence of the flame on its fuel is common in the Suttas, this exact metaphor is not found elsewhere. Normally the Buddha employs metaphors in an ABA structure: he explains the doctrine, illustrates it, and repeats the explanation. Here, however, the metaphor acts as a springboard for the next stage of the argument, the impermanence of feelings. ",
  "mn146:10.1": "This is another unique application of a familiar image. A similar metaphor for the six senses as the shadow of a post is found at [an4.195:11.1](). ",
  "mn146:11.2": "Antara is “connecting”, not “inner”. ",
  "mn146:27.5": "On the strength of this teaching, Nandaka was declared the foremost in advising nuns ([an1.229:1.1]()). "
