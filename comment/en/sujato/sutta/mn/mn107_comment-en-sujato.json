  "mn107:2.4": "Memorizing the Vedic texts, a key skill of the brahmins, was so difficult that they sometimes asked the Buddha for advice ([an5.193:8.4]()). Details on the gradual memorization of texts are found at [pli-tv-bu-vb-pc4:2.1.7](). Texts were learned by line (teacher and student start and finish together), by going after the line (one starts, they finish together), by going after the syllable (the teacher prompts with the first syllable of the line), and by phrase (the teacher says the first phrase, the student the second).

  "mn107:2.6": "Archery (_issattha_) is regularly listed as a craft or livelihood ([mn14:7.3]()), which took skill in training ([sn56.45:1.3]()), and to which a mendicant is compared ([an4.196:10.3]()). ",

The “trainee” (_sekha_) in the strict sense is restricted to those who have entered the ranks of the Noble Ones (_ariyapuggala_) through the realization of the four noble truths (eg. [sn48.53:3.1]()). However, in cases such as this it would be over-strict to insist that the teaching applies only to Noble Ones, as the Gradual Training is the recommended practice for all new monastics.
