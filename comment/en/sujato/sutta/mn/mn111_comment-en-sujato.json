  "mn111:1.1": "This discourse describes Sāriputta’s practice of discernment leading to awakening. It fills in the blanks between realizing stream entry and arahantship, reminding us that when a narrative depicts a person realizing the truth while listing to a teaching—as Sāriputta does—there is usually an extensive background of practice behind that. A number of indications suggest that this is among the later discourses: there are no parallels, the exposition is unusually elaborate; and there are textual indications of editing. ",
  "mn111:2.2": "These are qualities of the Buddha at [dn30:1.26.6]() and of Sāriputta again at [sn8.7:3.2](). ",
  "mn111:2.3": "“Widespread wisdom” is defined at [an3.30:3.1]() as one who often listens to teachings, applies their mind while listening, and continues to do so afterwards. ",
  "mn111:2.8": "The fortnight between realizing stream-entry while still a student of Sañjaya ([pli-tv-kd1:23.5.6]()) and arahantship while overhearing the Buddha teach Dīghanakha ([mn74:5.1]()). ",
  "mn111:4.1": "_Vavatthita_ (“distinguished”) occurs elsewhere in the Suttas in only one late verse ([dn20:6.10]()). The Vinaya gives it as an antonym to _sambhinna_, “mixed” ([pli-tv-kd13:33.1.7]()). | The first five items here are the five so-called “jhāna factors” (see [ps1.5:10.2](), [ds2.1.1:3.1]()). ",
  "mn111:22.2": "Also said of Sāriputta at [sn8.7:3.2](). "
