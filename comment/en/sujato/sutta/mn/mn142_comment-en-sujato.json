  "mn142:5.1": "“Religious donation” (_dakkhiṇā_) is a Vedic term for the payment owed a brahmin priest for performing ritual services (_dakṣiṇā_). In the Rig Veda this gift was of cattle offered at the dawn service; it yields benefits as the cow yields milk, and as Dawn sheds her bounteous light. Later, the _dakṣiṇā_ was said to absolve the sacrificer from the guilt of killing, an overriding concern of the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa (1.2.3.4). The Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa emphasizes how the dead sacrifice—a slain animal or pressed soma—is “enlivened” through the _dakṣiṇā_ (2.2.2.2). In the Pali tradition, _dakkhiṇa_ is etymologically linked with a gift given by the “right” or “capable” hand. "
