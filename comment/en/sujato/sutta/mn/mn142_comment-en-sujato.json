  "mn142:2.1": "Mahāpajapati was the Buddha’s foster-mother, sister of his birth mother Māyā. Here she is still a lay person, so this event must have preceded her request for ordination ([an8.51:20.1]()). She was honored as the most senior of the nuns ([an1.235:1.1]()). She is mostly remember as the Buddha’s mother, but her own verses deconstruct her motherhood, relating how she has previously been a “mother, a son, a father, a brother, and a grandmother” but now has transcended all such states ([thig6.6:3.1]()).

  "mn142:5.1": "“Religious donation” (or “honorarium”, _dakkhiṇā_, Sanskrit _dakṣiṇā_) is a Vedic term for the payment owed a brahmin priest for performing ritual services. In the Rig Veda this gift was of cattle offered at the dawn service; it yields benefits as the cow yields milk, and as Dawn sheds her bounteous light. Later, the _dakṣiṇā_ was said to absolve the sacrificer from the guilt of killing (Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 1.2.3.4). This is an overriding concern of the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, hence it emphasizes how the dead sacrifice—a slain animal or pressed soma—is “enlivened” through the _dakṣiṇā_ (2.2.2.2). In the Pali tradition, _dakkhiṇa_ is etymologically linked with a gift given by the “right” or “capable” hand. "
