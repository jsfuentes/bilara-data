  "mn130:10.1": "The Rig Veda speaks of evil-doers facing the “erasure of the wolf”, the “downfall” ( 2.29.6c), the “bottomless darkness” (7.104.3) that is “beneath all three earths” (7.104.11), the “endless abyss” (7.104.17), the “darkness below” (10.152.4). Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 11.6.1 contains an allegory or vision that seems to reflect notions of hell. In the much later Purāṇic literature descriptions of hells, usually numbered 21 or 28, are a standard feature (eg. Agni Purāṇa 203, 371; Brahma Purāṇa 20, 106; Brahmāṇḍa Purāṇa 4.2; Viṣṇu Purāṇa 2.6; Skanda Purāṇa 6.1.226; Śiva Purāṇa 5.8; Devī Bhāgavata Purāṇa 8.21–23; Bhāgavata Purāṇa 5.26). "
