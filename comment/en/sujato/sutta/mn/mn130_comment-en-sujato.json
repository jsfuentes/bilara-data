  "mn130:10.1": "Similar descriptions of hells, usually numbered 21 or 28, are a standard feature of Purāṇic literature (eg. Agni Purāṇa 203, 371; Brahma Purāṇa 20, 106; Brahmāṇḍa Purāṇa 4.2; Viṣṇu Purāṇa 2.6; Skanda Purāṇa 6.1.226; Śiva Purāṇa 5.8; Devī Bhāgavata Purāṇa 8.21–23; Bhāgavata Purāṇa 5.26). These, however, are all much later than the Suttas. The Vedas appear to have no conception of hell. Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 11.6.1 contains an allegory or vision that seems to reflect notions of hell. "
