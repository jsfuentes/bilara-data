  "mn130:10.1": "The Rig Veda speaks of evil-doers facing the “erasure of the wolf”, the “downfall” ( 2.29.6c), the “bottomless darkness” (7.104.3) “beneath all three earths” (7.104.11), the “endless abyss” (7.104.17), the “darkness below” (10.152.4). Atharva Veda similarly speaks of the “house below” (2.14.3a), the “deepest dark” (8.2.24). A man stingy with cattle is destined for the _nārakaṃ lokaṃ_ (12.4.36c), which seems, however, to mean not hell but the “human realm” in contrast with the blessed realm of Yama. Jaiminīya Brāhmaņa 1.42 describes the “yonder world” in both hellish and heavenly terms; this story also appears in Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 11.6.1, where it is presented as a journey to the four directions rather than explicitly after death. In both cases it has an allegorical cast and does not share many details in common with the Buddhist account. It is not until the much later Purāṇic literature that lurid descriptions of hells, usually numbered 21 or 28, become a standard feature (eg. Agni Purāṇa 203, 371; Brahma Purāṇa 20, 106; Brahmāṇḍa Purāṇa 4.2; Viṣṇu Purāṇa 2.6; Skanda Purāṇa 6.1.226; Śiva Purāṇa 5.8; Devī Bhāgavata Purāṇa 8.21–23; Bhāgavata Purāṇa 5.26). ",

  "mn130:20.3": "“Needle-mouth” (_sūcimukha_) is one of the 28 Purāṇic hells, the destiny of scrooges, where one is stitched as cloth by a tailor (Bhāgavata Purāṇa 526.36, Devī Bhāgavata Purāṇa 8.23). Śiva Purāṇa 5.9.42–3 describes how sinners are devoured by sharp-toothed worms while rotting in mounds of flesh. ",
  "mn130:23.1": "This befalls those who destroy forests (Brahmāṇḍa Purāṇa 4.2.173, Viṣṇu Purāṇa 6.2) , while Agni Purāṇa 203.10 says it is for one who killed their mother. ",
