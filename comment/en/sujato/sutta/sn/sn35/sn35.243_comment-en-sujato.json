  "sn35.243:1.2": "The completion of a town hall was celebrated by a talk for the Sakyans at [mn53:2.1]() and the Mallas at [dn33:1.2.1](). Such halls were community meeting places that played a central role in civic society and communal decision-making in democratic republics such as the Mallas and the Sakyans. The Buddha’s participation is a sign of his support for their civic and democratic process. ",
