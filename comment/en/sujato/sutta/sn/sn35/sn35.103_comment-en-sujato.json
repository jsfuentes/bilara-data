  "sn35.103:1.2": "The idiom of this verse is very unlike the suttas. Its obscurity is intentional, for “the gods love hidden things”. There seems no reason to doubt it is a genuine quote, but I have not been able to trace it. | The initial pronoun _idaṁ_ is neuter, and serves as an emphatic particle disconnected from the masculine nouns. Compare the use of _idam_ at Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 3.6.1.5, 3.7.1.2, 13.8.2.15. | A similar phrasing is employed by Brahmā Sahampati at [sn6.13:5.1](), where it emphasizes direct experience. | In early Sanskrit and Pali, _jātu_ usually has the sense “ever” (Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 2.2.2.20, 14.6.8.1). ",
  "sn35.103:1.5": "We should perhaps read _kaṇṭa_ (“thorn”) for text’s _gaṇḍa_ (“boil”); compare Āśvalāyanagṛhyasūtra 2.7.5, _kaṇṭaki kṣīriṇastu samūlān parikhāya udvāsayet_ (“one should dig out and remove to the root plants with thorns and sap”). But _gaṇḍamūla_ is also attested at [thag4.10:4.1]() where the context supports “boil’s root”. ",
  "sn35.103:1.6": "The story of the Bodhisatta’s studentship under Uddaka implies that he had not attained the highest meditation that he taught ([mn26:16.9](), etc.). Nonetheless, the Buddha respected him, which suggests that in making these claims he was not knowingly lying. He likely believed that he had attained, but his understanding was insufficient by the Buddha’s standards. | The Buddha assumes that the impersonal pronoun (_idaṁ_) refers to Uddaka himself (_asmi_). The Upaniṣadic doctrine of the identity of the self with the impersonal cosmic divinity is often expressed in similar terms: “you are that” (_tat tvam asi_, Chāndogya Upaniṣad 6.8.7), “that self is divinity” (_ayam ātmā brahma_, Māṇḍūkya Upaniṣad 1.2), “I am that” (_so’ham asmi_, Īśa Upaniṣad 16).
