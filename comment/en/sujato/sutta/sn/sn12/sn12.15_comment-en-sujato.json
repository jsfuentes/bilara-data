  "sn12.15:2.1": "The Buddha is indicating that he is referring to a widely held belief. This idea is in fact prominently featured in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa: “This is twofold, there is no third: truth and falsehood. The gods are truth, humans are falsehood” (_dvayaṃ vā idaṃ na tṛtīyamasti | satyaṃ caivānṛtaṃ ca satyameva devā anṛtam manuṣyā_; 1.1.1.4, 3.3.2.2, 3.9.4.1). The word for “truth” here is _satya_ (Pali _sacca_), which like _atthitā_ (“existence”) is an abstract noun from the root _as_, “to exist”. The word for “falsehood” is _anṛta_, a form not used in this sense in Pali, so it has been replaced by the simple negative. The gods are truly real because they are immortal, whereas transient humans are not truly real. _Satya_ and _anṛta_ are a standard pair in pre-Buddhist Sanskrit, harking back to Rig Veda 7.49.3a. "
