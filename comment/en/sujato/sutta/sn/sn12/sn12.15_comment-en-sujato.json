  "sn12.15:2.1": "The Buddha is indicating that he is referring to a widely held belief. This idea is in fact prominently featured in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa: “This is twofold, there is no third: truth and falsehood. The gods are truth, humans are falsehood” (_dvayaṃ vā idaṃ na tṛtīyamasti | satyaṃ caivānṛtaṃ ca satyameva devā anṛtam manuṣyā_; 1.1.1.4, 3.3.2.2, 3.9.4.1). The word for “truth” here is _satya_ (Pali _sacca_), which like _atthitā_ (“existence”) is an abstract noun from the root _as_, “to exist”. The word for “falsehood” is _anṛta_, a form not used in this sense in Pali. The gods are truly real because they are immortal, whereas transient humans are not truly real. "
