  "sn12.15:2.1": "The Buddha is indicating that he is referring to a widely held belief. Compare the prominent saying: “This is twofold (_dvayaṁ_), there is no third: truth and falsehood. The gods are truth, humans are falsehood” (Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 1.1.1.4, 3.3.2.2, 3.9.4.1). The word for “truth” here is _satya_ (Pali _sacca_), which like _atthitā_ (“existence”) is an abstract noun from the root _as_, “to exist”. The word for “falsehood” is _anṛta_, a form not used in this sense in Pali, so it has been replaced by the simple negative. The gods are truly real because they are immortal, whereas transient humans are not truly real. _Satya_ and _anṛta_ are a standard pair in pre-Buddhist Sanskrit, harking back to Rig Veda 7.49.3a. Consider also the hymn of creation at Arthavaveda 10.2.14c: “Who placed truth in him, who falsehood, who mortality, who immortality?” "
