  "sn12.65:3.3": "BB’s rendering makes it seem that the mutual conditioning clauses are syntactically distinct, and connected to this sentence. This is the case in the related passage at DN 15. But here in the Pali this sentence serves to introduce the entire set of conditions. ",
  "sn12.65:7.1": "Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 4.4.8 quotes an ancient verse to the effect: “I have reached the subtle, extensive, ancient road; it has been realized by me” (_aṇuḥ panthā vitataḥ purāṇo māṁ spṛṣṭ’onuvitto mayaiva_). | _Añjasa_ (“route”) is elsewhere in Pali used only in poetry (eg, [thag1.35:1.3]()) or by brahmins ([dn13:4.2]()). It is an old Vedic term for the “direct route” to the right place as advised by Pūṣan (Rig Veda 6.54.1). In the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, the new and full moon offerings are made “directly and expressly” to Indra and Agni (2.4.17); one goes “directly to the truth” after a dispute over supremacy among the gods is resolved (3.4.2.14); the horse knows the “direct” way to heaven that humans do not, like one who knows the country (13.2.3–2); and Yājñavalkya explains how to go “directly” to complete the sacrifice (13.5.3.5). One beholds “directly” that the self is god (Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 4.4.15). ",
  "sn12.65:7.3": "The idea of such “lost cities” decaying in the jungle is probably sparked by the archaeological remains of the Indus Valley Civilization, whose extensive cities would have been a thousand years old for the Buddha. "
