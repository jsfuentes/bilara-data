  "sn2.9:2.3": "I suspect that _sambādha_ here, which can refer to the vagina, contains a hint or echo of pregnancy: Rāhu will give birth to the moon. ",
  "sn2.9:7.3": "_Abhigīta_ first appears with regards to a drop of Soma that has been “chanted over”, “besung”, or “enchanted” and hence imbued with potency (Rig Veda 9.96.23). Throughout Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 8.5.4 it is used more prosaically: a history of horse sacrifices is listed, each event honored with a specific verse “sung about” it. In Pali, the phrase _gāthābhigīta_ is found only in this passage and when the Buddha refused to eat food “chanted over” by a brahmins (eg. [sn7.8:8.1]()). In both cases the chanting has a mysterious potency, so I render “enchanted with verse”. "
