  "sn2.30:15.1": "The celebration of Namuci’s defeat by Māṇavagāmiya is a striking verbal allusion to Rig Veda 5.30.7c, where the defeat of Namuci opened the way for “the progress of Manu” (_manave gātum_, Rig Veda 5.30.7c), i.e. the spread of the Aryan peoples who were Manu’s children. Reading Pali _gāmiya_ as a secondary derivation from _gama_, “going”, yields the sense, “The Progress of Manu’s Children”. Here the term can have the Buddhist sense of the path of the Aryans. "
