  "sn7.9:3.2": "The line plays with _jāti_ (“birth”), _jāyati_ (“give birth”), and _jātaveda_. The latter term is a Vedic word for fire or “flame”. Its meaning is obscure, but I think the sense is _jāta_ (“those who have been born”, i.e. “mortals”) plus _vedas_ (“knowledge”), i.e. “one who brings knowledge to mortals”. This is the fire-god Agni, who comes down from the sun to the sacrificial fire, bringing light and awareness and Vedic knowledge to those who have been born, namely mortal humans. In this passage, it implies that anyone who “has been born” can “give birth” to “knowledge” regardless of their “birth”. ",
  "sn7.9:4.3": "BB has “invoke” for _upavhayati_, implying that the addressee is spoken to in formal religious verse. However the word appears only once elsewhere, in DN 20 Mahāsamaya, where it refers to the _supaṇṇas_ and _nāgas_, after the Buddha arranged a peace treaty, speaking to each other with gentle words. In both contexts we have the idea of an initial tension, perhaps ideological opposition, reconciled or bridged with words. I detect something of this is the prefix _upa-_, which commonly has a sense of closeness or warmth. Perhaps the closest to this is the notion of introducing oneself, breaking the ice, as at a gathering. ",
  "sn7.9:12.1": "PTS Dict traces samādahati to ādahati1, i.e. to assemble or put together. I can’t find a relevant discussion of this, so perhaps it is well know, but the term—and _samādhi_ likewise—must, like jhāna, also include the fire metaphor. This usage is found throughout Bu Pc 56. Unfortunately, the vibhanga there doesn’t define samadahati. However the offence falls for samadahati a fire; and surely this cannot mean to simply assemble the wood. It must mean, as acknowledged in the translations and Dicts, to kindle. However such a sense cannot be traced to ādahati1 and must be drawn from ādahati2, i.e. = dahati, to burn, ignite. ",
  "sn7.9:14.1": "BB explains kharibhara as the double-tray with poles for carrying, which seems unlikely. In old images of brahmins I don’t see them using this, it seems more like a worker’s thing. I think it refers to the various paraphenalia that a brahmin carries with him, maybe in as houlder bag. Such things, in modern Buddhist culture anyway, serve as a subtle reminder of status, which aligns with the metaphor. I’ve tried to translate to bring the metaphor out rather than the thing. ",
