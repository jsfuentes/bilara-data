  "ja5:1.1": "_Nāḷikā_ (“cup”) is literally a “tube” of bamboo. From [sn3.13:6.1]() we can see that a cup of rice was sufficient for a modest serving. ",
  "ja5:1.2": "The first two lines are spoken by horse traders, who have been told that their 500 horses are worth only a cup of rice. They ask the king what then is the value of a cup of rice when it comes to pricing horses. | The importance of correct valuation is attested by the detailed breakdowns in such texts as Arthaśāstra 2.19 and Manusmṛti 8.131–137. ",
  "ja5:1.4": "The answer was that a cup of rice is worth the whole of Varanasi with its suburbs. These two lines record the derision of the court. Note that the prose story attributes the foolish valuations to a court-appointed valuer of whom the verse makes no mention. Taking the verse on its own, it would appear that it is the king himself who makes the false valuation. "
