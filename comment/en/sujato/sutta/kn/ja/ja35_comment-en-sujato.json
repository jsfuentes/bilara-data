  "ja35:1.1": "A little quail, alone in the face of a great fire, makes a sincere Asservation of Truth. | This verse, which remains a popular protection chant, is also found at [cp29:10.1](). ",
  "ja35:1.4": "_Jātaveda_ is found commonly in the Rig veda and rarely in the Pali canon; but where it does occur it is mostly in the Jātakas. This shows how Vedic ideas are still alive in this collection. While _jātaveda_ on one level just means “fire”, here it is addressed as an agent who can respond to pleas, so the idea of _jātaveda_ as the imminent deity Agni, who brings “knowledge to mortals”, is close to the surface.
