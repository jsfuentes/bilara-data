  "ja35:1.1": "A little quail, alone in the face of a great fire, makes a sincere Asservation of Truth. | This verse, which remains a popular protection chant, is also found at [cp29:10.1](). | The bird in question is probably the jungle bush quail, which roosts on the ground. This small and adorable bird evoked feelings of protectiveness; it always seems to be in need of rescue, whether from wolves (Rig Ved 1.116.14), birds of prey, hunters, elephants, or, as here, fire. ",
  "ja35:1.4": "_Jātaveda_ is found commonly in the Rig Veda and rarely in the Pali canon; but where it does occur it is mostly in the Jātakas. This shows how Vedic ideas are still alive in this collection. While _jātaveda_ on one level just means “fire”, here it is addressed as an agent, the imminent deity Agni, who brings “knowledge to mortals”. "
