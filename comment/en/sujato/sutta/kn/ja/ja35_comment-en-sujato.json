  "ja35:1.1": "A little quail, alone in the face of a great fire, turns back a wall of flame with the power of truth. | This verse, which remains a popular protection chant, is also found at [cp29:10.1](). | The bird in question is probably the jungle bush quail, which roosts on the ground. This small and adorable bird always seems to be in need of rescue, whether from wolves (Rig Veda 1.116.14), birds of prey, hunters, elephants, or, as here, fire. ",
  "ja35:1.4": "_Jātaveda_ is found commonly in the Rig Veda and rarely in the Pali canon. Where it does occur it is mostly in the Jātakasm showing how Vedic ideas are still alive in this collection. While _jātaveda_ on one level just means “fire”, here it is addressed as an agent who can respond to pleas. This is _jātaveda_ as the imminent deity Agni, who brings “knowledge to mortals”. "
