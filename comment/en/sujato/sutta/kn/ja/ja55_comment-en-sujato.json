  "ja55:1.1": "A prince is named “Five-weapons” after a prophecy when he was born. The prophecy was fulfilled when, on returning from his studies in Takkasilā in Gandhāra, he encountered a ferocious native spirit (_yakkha_) in a forest and fought it with five weapons, persevering without success. The monster, recognizing his courage, let him go. | The five weapons were sword, spear, battle-axe, bow, and mace. "
