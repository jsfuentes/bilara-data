  "ja55:1.1": "A prince is named “Five-weapons” after a prophecy when he was born. The prophecy was fulfilled when, on returning from his studies in Takkasilā in Gandhāra, he encountered a ferocious native spirit (_yakkha_) in a forest and fought it with five weapons; but each attach only got him stuck to the monster’s shaggy coat. The monster, recognizing his courage, let him go. | The five weapons are the arrow (_sara_), sword (_khagga_), spear (_kaṇaya_), club (_muggara_), lance (_kunta_). But his real weapon is the _vajira_ (“diamond” or “thunderbolt”) which is the weapon of knowledge. "
