  "ja39:1.1": "Before his death, the father entrusts only his servant with the location of his buried wealth, fearing that his young wife would waste the money on a new man. The trust went to the servant’s head, as when he arrived with the heir at the location, he started cursing rather than reveal the treasure. The heir deduced that that was the spot to dig. ",
  "ja39:1.3": "_Āma_ is from Vedic _amā_ (“house”), but is explained by the commentary as “with consent”. ",
  "ja39:1.4": "The commentary hints at the real motivation for Nanda’s odd behavior. The family is fond of him, calling him _tāta_ (“my dear”) and _mātula_ (“uncle”); he has surely been with the father long before the young wife arrived. So when his curse starts, “You bastard son of a slave girl” (_are dāsiputta ceṭaka_), it shows what he thought of his master’s young wife and her son. There is no question of punishment for his insolence, but the tone shifts, as he is called “slave” (_dāsa_) and bluntly ordered to carry the treasure home. "
