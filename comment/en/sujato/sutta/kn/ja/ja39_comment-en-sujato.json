  "ja39:1.1": "Before his death, the father entrusts only his servant with the location of his buried wealth. The trust evidently went to the servant’s head, as when he arrived with the heir at the location, he started cursing rather than reveal the treasure. The heir deduced that that was the spot to dig. ",
  "ja39:1.3": "_Āma_ is from Vedic _amā_ (“house”), but is explained by the commentary as “with consent”. ",
  "ja39:1.4": "There seems to be a layer beneath Nanda’s odd behavior. The family is familiar with him, calling him _tāta_ (“my dear”) and _mātula_ (“uncle”); he has surely been with the family longer than the young wife and her son. The commentary says his curse starts, “You bastard son of a slave girl” (_are dāsiputta ceṭaka_), which shows what he thought of his master’s young wife and her son. There is no question of punishment for his insolence, but the tone shifts, as he is called “slave” (_dāsa_) and bluntly ordered to carry the treasure home. "
