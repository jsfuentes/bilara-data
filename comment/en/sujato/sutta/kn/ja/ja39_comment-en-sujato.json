  "ja39:1.1": "Before his death, the father entrusted only his servant Nanda with the location of his buried wealth, fearing that his young wife would waste the money on a new man rather than give it to his true heir, her son. But when the servant arrived at the location with the heir, out of conceit he started cursing rather than reveal the treasure. The verse records the advice given to the son by his father’s old friend. ",
  "ja39:1.3": "_Āma_ is from Vedic _amā_ (“house”), but is explained by the commentary as “with consent”. ",
  "ja39:1.4": "The commentary hints at the real motivation for Nanda’s odd behavior. Having been with the father since birth, he is called _tāta_ (“my dear”) and _mātula_ (“uncle”), as if he were the master’s brother. So when he curses the heir, “You bastard son of a slave girl” (_are dāsiputta ceṭaka_), it shows what he thought of his master’s young wife and her son. There is no question of punishment for his insolence, but the tone shifts, as he is called “slave” (_dāsa_) and bluntly ordered to carry the treasure home. "
