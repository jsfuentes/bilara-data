  "ja39:1.1": "Before his death, the father entrusts only his servant with the location of his buried wealth. The trust evidently went to the servant’s head, as when he took the heir to the location, he started cursing rather than reveal the treasure. The heir deduced that that was the spot to dig. ",
  "ja39:1.3": "_Āma_ is from Vedic _amā_ (“house”), but is explained by the commentary as “with consent”. "
