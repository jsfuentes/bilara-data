  "ja7:1.1": "The story tells of a king who visited a park. Spying a simple country girl gathering wood, he became enamoured and they had sex. Knowing that she had conceived, she told the king, who gave her a signet ring. Later, she presented herself with the child at court, but the king denied them, even when the ring was shown. Not until the child was thrown in the air did the king relent. "
