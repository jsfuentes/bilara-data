  "ja13:1.1": "A naive mountain buck falls for a doe wily in the ways of men. When the path grows dangerous, she lets him lead the way, so that he falls to the arrow. This is the first of many misogynistic Jātakas. ",
  "ja13:1.4": "Experience has shown this ancient prejudice to be untrue, as studies show that women leaders are at least as successful as men in both perception and results. ",
  "ja13:1.5": "_Dikkhitā_ (“cursed”) is a word of unique occurrence in Pali. It is from the same root as the more common imprecation _dhiratthu_ (“cursed be!”). Both are glossed with _√garah_. "
