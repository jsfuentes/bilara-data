  "ja15:1.1": "The story tells how the Bodhisatta declared the deer unteachable after he failed to show for lessons on the ruses of deer seven times. The verses and stories form a pair with the next Jātaka. Though the verses are in different metres, the prevalence of shared terms, ideas, and poetic play shows they must have been composed together. | The commentary takes _kharādiye_ as the vocative of  _kharādiyā_, the name of the Bodhisatta’s sister, drawing on the mention of the nephew in the next verse. However, I take _khara_ as “ass, mule” and _ādiye_ as second optative, “you should accept”. Asses have solid hooves, as opposed to the cloven-footed deer, and I take the lines as illustrating the ineptitude of the candidate. ",
  "ja15:1.2": "The commentary says his antlers were “crooked root to tip”. But it probably refers to the ruses of animals ([mn51:4.14](), [an8.13:1.11]()). ",
  "ja15:1.3": "The first and third lines begin with “eight” and “seven” respectively. The teacher is saying that even after these seven failures, the student still has not exhausted his bad behavior. "
