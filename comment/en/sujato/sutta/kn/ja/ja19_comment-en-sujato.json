  "ja19:1.1": "The story is that a merchant makes a sacrifice to ensure the success of his voyage, vowing that on his return he will perform another sacrifice, freeing him from his vow. The verse is riddling, so I translate literally and paraphrase in the comments. | “If you want to be released from your vow, you will have to wait until after you are dead.” ",
  "ja19:1.2": "“Because the act of sacrificing an animal does not release you from anything; rather, it binds you to suffering.” "
