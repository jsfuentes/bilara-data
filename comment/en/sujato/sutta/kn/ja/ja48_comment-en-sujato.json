  "ja48:1.1": "The commentary says that a brahmin named Vedabbha, being captured by bandits from Cetī, paid his ransom through a wealth-granting spell also named Vedabbha. But that only inflames the bandits’ desires, and they end up killing him and each other. ",
  "ja48:1.3": "The commentary says Vedabbha is the name of the brahmin who was killed by bandits from Cetī, and also the name of the spell he wielded. However, Vaidarbha is a well-established name for the king of Vidarbha, a country to the south of Cetī. Given that the verse does not mention bandits, spells, or brahmins, it seems likely the original story concerned a raid by the Cetans that resulted in the death of the king of Vidarbha. "
