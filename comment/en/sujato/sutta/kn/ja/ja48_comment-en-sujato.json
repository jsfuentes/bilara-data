  "ja48:1.1": "The commentary says that a brahmin named Vedabbha, being captured by bandits from Cetī, paid his ransom through a wealth-granting spell also named Vedabbha. But that only inflames the bandits’ desires, and they end up killing him and each other. ",
  "ja48:1.3": "Despite the commentary, the verse does not mention bandits, spells, or brahmins. Vedabbha (Sanskrit _vaidarbha_) is a well-established name for the king of Vidarbha, a country to the south of Cetī. It seems the original story concerned a raid by the Cetans that resulted in the death of the king of Vidarbha. "
