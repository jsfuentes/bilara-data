  "ja1:2.1": "_Apaṇṇaka_ (“unfailing”) is a gambling term, where _paṇṇa_ appears as a form of the number five. While a hand of four dice was “perfect” (_kaṭaggaha_), the fifth “losing” (_kali_) die was all-powerful, since just one extra die meant you lose everything (Rig Veda 10.34.2, Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 5.4.4.6). _Apaṇṇaka_ is therefore literally a “set without a fifth” and metaphorically “without fail”. See further note on [mn60:12.5](). ",
  "ja1:2.2": "In the prose story, the “sophists” (_takkikā_) are compared to a native spirit (_yakkha_) who tried to persuade a caravan to abandon its water in the desert. "
