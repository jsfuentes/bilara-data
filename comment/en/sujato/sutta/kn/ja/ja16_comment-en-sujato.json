  "ja16:1.1": "This time, the deer attentively learns the ruses of deer and escapes the hunter by playing dead. ",
  "ja16:1.2": "Here _aṭṭha_ chimes with _aḍḍha_. Perhaps the sense is that the dainty tread of the cloven hooves make little sound as he steals his midnight drink. ",
  "ja16:1.4": "Here _kalā_ means “trick, deceit”. | _Chahi kalāhi_ here chimes with _sattahi kālāti_ in the previous verse. | Commentary takes _bhāgineyyo_ in its usual sense of “nephew”, but I think it is from _bhāgin_ by analogy with _dakkhiṇeyyo_, “one who deserves a share”. "
