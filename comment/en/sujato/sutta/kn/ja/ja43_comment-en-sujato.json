  "ja43:1.1": "An ascetic keeps a viper as a pet, despite being warned it will turn on him one day. | Similar to Aesop’s fable *The Farmer and the Viper*, this story is retold in modern songs and politics. ",
  "ja43:1.4": "The viper was named Veḷuka because it lived in a tube of bamboo (_veḷu_). The ascetic cared for it like a father. Note, however, that the verse says nothing about a viper and could have been attached to any story where the father of a Veḷuka ignored advice and met a bad end. Normally _veḷuka_ means a “bamboo worker”, and as such is the name of a lower caste in later texts. Compare [sn42.19](), where a low-caste acrobat who engages in a dangerous balancing act with their student is protected by the fact that they listen to each others’ wise advice. "
