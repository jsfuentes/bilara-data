  "ja3:1.1": "This verse is mostly the same as [an8.29:15.1](), which I believe is referring to the same story. The commentary tells of a fraudulent merchant who tried to trick a poor woman into thinking her gold vase was worthless. ",
  "ja3:1.4": "The commentary says his name was _serivā_, but this seems doubly implausible, as both protagonists are said to have this name after their city of Seri, which does not appear anywhere else. Rather, read _seri_ as “wanton”, for which see _svairī_ in Chāndogya Upaniṣad 5.11.5. Resolve the compound as _seri_ + _eva_ + _ayaṁ_ + _iva_. "
