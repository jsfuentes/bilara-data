  "ja21:1.1": "A wary antelope spots a hunter hiding in a tree and seeks elsewhere for fruit. | The _kuruṅga_ (Sanskrit _kuraṅga_) is the shy four-horned antelope (_Tetracerus quadricornis_). They have been described as solitary and unruly, fitting the depiction here. The Mṛgapakṣiśāstra says they are short and red, with branched horns and wide eyes. They often graze grass and are shrewd and patient. ",
