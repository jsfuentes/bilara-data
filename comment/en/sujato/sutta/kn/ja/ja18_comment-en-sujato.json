  "ja18:1.1": "A goat is being prepared for a sacrifice as an offering for the departed, but it startles with its alternate laughing and weeping. It turns out, it laughs because it knows its bad kamma is about to be expiated, and it weeps because it knows the sacrificer will suffer as he has. Goat sacrifice was known since Vedic times (Rig Veda 1.162, Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 6.2.1.2). "
