  "ja36:1.1": "“Evergreen” (_jagatirūha_, “earth-grower”) is a poetic term for a tree. ",
  "ja36:1.3": "_Vakkaṅga_ is a poetic term for “bird”, on account of them having “bent limbs”. In Sanskrit, this bird, variously spelled _vakrāṅga_ or _cakrāṅga_ is evidently identical with the _cakravāka_ or Brahminy goose; but geese do not live in trees. "
