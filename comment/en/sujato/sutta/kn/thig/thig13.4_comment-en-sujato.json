  "thig13.4:22.2": "_Hema_ is from _hima_ (“snow”). It evokes the golden radiance of a snowy mountain in the dawn light, a blessing of the gods that, it may easily be imagined, leaves its traces in the gold found in abundance in its streams. | Gold is also called _harita_ (“yellow”) at Atharvaveda 11.2.12a.
