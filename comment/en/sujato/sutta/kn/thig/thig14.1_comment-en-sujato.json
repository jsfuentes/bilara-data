  "thig14.1:10.4": "“Pixie” is _kinnarī_, this marking the only appearance of these charming woodland folk in early Pali. They share with the _gandhabba_ the attributes of being divine musicians, sometimes half-horse, and being sensual lovers, but where the _gandhabba_ is associated with licentiousness, the _kinnara_ and _kinnarī_ live together as a perfect dyad of lovers, ever entranced with one another, and perpetually childless. They are the spirits of nature, hidden in the mountains, and thretened by human encroachment ([ja485](). | The beauty pf the pixie’s eyes are praised at [ja458:1.3](). "
