  "ud1.4:1.1": "This story also appears at <a href='https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd1/en/sujato#2.1.1'>Kd 1:2.1.1</a>. Sharing three rare terms—<i lang='pi' translate='no'>huṁ</i>, <i lang='pi' translate='no'>brahmavāda</i>, <i lang='pi' translate='no'>kāsāva</i>—with the Chāndogya Upaniṣad, it can be read as a rebuttal of the Chāndogya’s special emphasis on the mystic power of Vedic ritual utterances (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>sāman</i>). ",
  "ud1.4:2.1": "<i lang='pi' translate='no'>Huṁhuṅkajātiko brāhmaṇo</i> is literally, “a brahmin of the <i lang='pi' translate='no'>huṁ</i>, <i lang='pi' translate='no'>huṁ</i> sort”. Chāndogya Upaniṣad 1.13 lists twelve mystic syllables (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>stobha</i>) that are uttered by the assistant priest (Adhvaryu) during the recitation of the <i lang='pi' translate='no'>sāman</i> hymn. The thirteenth syllable is <i lang='pi' translate='no'>huṁ</i>, said to be variable and “indistinct” (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>anirukta</i>). It contains the last and most closed-off of the cardinal vowels (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>u</i>), which creates an indistinct mumble, reflecting the undefined nature of the primordial divinity. Its significance is underlined by the fact that the next and final verse of the chapter calls it the <i lang='pi' translate='no'>upaniṣad</i>, the “hidden connection”. Much later, this was adopted by the Śivites in such texts as the Hūṅkāra Tantra; from there it made its way into such Tibetan texts as the Ḍākārṇava Tantra, where it is said to be recited at the end, reflecting its phonetic quality exactly as in the Upaniṣad. It is recognizable today as the final syllable in the mantra, <i lang='pi' translate='no'>om mani padme hum</i>. ",

  "ud1.4:4.2": "“Unstained” is from <i lang='pi' translate='no'>kasāva</i>, which occurs in the same sense at Chāndogya Upaniṣad 7.26.2 (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>mṛditakaṣāyāya</i>). ",
  "ud1.4:4.3": "The “knowledge” in <i lang='pi' translate='no'>vedagū</i> is the Vedas in Brahmanism and the three knowledges in Buddhism. It is not an attested term in Brahmanical texts. | For <i lang='pi' translate='no'>vūsitabrahmacariyo</i> (“completed the spiritual journey”) compare <i lang='pi' translate='no'>uṣitvā brahmacaryaṁ</i> at Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 5.2.1. ",
  "ud1.4:4.4": "This, the only occurrence of <i lang='pi' translate='no'>brahmavāda</i> in Pali, harks back to the brahmin’s role as a reciter of the <i lang='pi' translate='no'>sāman</i>. In Brahmanical texts it has the sense of “orthodox Vedic doctrine” (Atharva Veda 11.3.26a, 15.1.8a, Chāndogya Upaniṣad 2.24.1), comparable to the sense of Theravāda (“doctrine of the elders”). Here the Buddha, as so often, adapts the meaning to his own ends. ",
  "ud1.4:4.5": "“Pretensions” renders <i lang='pi' translate='no'>ussadā</i>. This line is found in the Aṭṭhavagga (<a href='https://suttacentral.net/snp4.3/en/sujato#4.4'>Snp 4.3:4.4</a> and note). Here it appears as the last line of the only five-line stanza in the Udāna. The previous line is grammatically complete, as the demonstrative <i lang='pi' translate='no'>so</i> answers the relative <i lang='pi' translate='no'>yo</i> in the opening line. I suspect it has been added from the earlier Aṭṭhavagga, perhaps to downplay the importance of the term <i lang='pi' translate='no'>brahmavāda</i> in the previous line. "
