  "ud1.4:2.1": "Chāndogya Upaniṣad 1.13 lists twelve mystic syllables that are uttered by the assistant preist (Adhvaryu) during the recitation of the Vedic _sāman_ hymn. The thirteenth, unuttered, syllable is _huṁ_. This was adopted by tantric Buddhists, and is recognizable today as the final syllable in the mantra, _om mani padme hum_. "
