  "ud1.4:2.1": "_Huṁhuṅkajātiko brāhmaṇo_ is literally, “a brahmin of the _huṁ_, _huṁ_ sort”. Chāndogya Upaniṣad 1.13 lists twelve mystic syllables that are uttered by the assistant priest (Adhvaryu) during the recitation of the _sāman_ hymn. The Chandogya, as it belongs to the liturgical Sāma Veda tradition, has a special interest in the mystical meanings of words recited in the ritual. The thirteenth syllable is _huṁ_, said to be variable and “indistinct” (_anirukta_). The last and most closed-off of the cardinal vowels (_u_) is deployed to create a sound mumbled indistinctly, reflecting the undefined nature of the primordial divinity. Its significance is underlined by the fact that the next and final verse of the chapter calls it the _upaniṣad_, the “hidden connection”. Much later, this was adopted by the Śivites in such texts as the Hūṅkāra Tantra, from where it was adopted into such Tibetan texts as the Ḍākārṇava Tantra, where it is said to be recited at the end, reflecting its phonetic quality exactly as in the Upaniṣad. It is recognizable today as the final syllable in the mantra, _om mani padme hum_. "
