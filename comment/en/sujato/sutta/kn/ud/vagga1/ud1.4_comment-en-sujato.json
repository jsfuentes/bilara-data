  "ud1.4:1.1": "This story also appears at [pli-tv-kd1:2.1.1](). Sharing three rare terms—_huṁ_, _brahmavāda_, _kāsāva_—with the Chāndogya Upaniṣad, it can be read as a rebuttal of the Chāndogya’s special emphasis on the mystic power of Vedic utterances. ",
  "ud1.4:2.1": "_Huṁhuṅkajātiko brāhmaṇo_ is literally, “a brahmin of the _huṁ_, _huṁ_ sort”. Chāndogya Upaniṣad 1.13 lists twelve mystic syllables (_stobha_) that are uttered by the assistant priest (Adhvaryu) during the recitation of the _sāman_ hymn. The Chandogya, as it belongs to the liturgical Sāma Veda tradition, has a special interest in the mystical meanings of words recited in the ritual. The thirteenth syllable is _huṁ_, said to be variable and “indistinct” (_anirukta_). The last and most closed-off of the cardinal vowels (_u_) creates an indistinct mumble, reflecting the undefined nature of the primordial divinity. Its significance is underlined by the fact that the next and final verse of the chapter calls it the _upaniṣad_, the “hidden connection”. Much later, this was adopted by the Śivites in such texts as the Hūṅkāra Tantra; from there it made its way into such Tibetan texts as the Ḍākārṇava Tantra, where it is said to be recited at the end, reflecting its phonetic quality exactly as in the Upaniṣad. It is recognizable today as the final syllable in the mantra, _om mani padme hum_. ",
  "ud1.4:4.1": "This pun is explained at [mn39:24.2](). ",
  "ud1.4:4.2": "“Unstained” is from _kasāva_, which occurs in the same sense at Chāndogya Upaniṣad 7.26.2 (_mṛditakaṣāyāya_). ",
  "ud1.4:4.3": "The “knowledge” in _vedagū_ is the Vedas in Brahmanism and the three knowledges in Buddhism. It is not an attested term in Brahmanical texts. | For _vūsitabrahmacariyo_ (“completed the spiritual journey”) compare _uṣitvā brahmacaryaṁ_ at Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 5.2.1. ",
  "ud1.4:4.4": "This, the only occurrence of _brahmavāda_ in Pali, harks back to the brahmin’s role as a reciter of the _sāman_. In Brahmanical texts it has the sense of “orthodox Vedic doctrine” (Atharva Veda 11.3.26a, 15.1.8a, Chāndogya Upaniṣad 2.24.1), comparable to the sense of Theravāda (“doctrine of the elders”). Here the Buddha, as so often, adapts the meaning to his own ends. ",
  "ud1.4:4.5": "“Pretensions” renders _ussadā_. This line is found in the Aṭṭhavagga ([snp4.3:4.4]() and note). Here it appears as the last line of the only five-line stanza in the Udāna. The previous line is grammatically complete, as the demonstrative _so_ answers the relative _yo_ in the opening line. I suspect it has been added from the earlier Aṭṭhavagga, perhaps to downplay the importance of the term _brahmavāda_ in the previous line. "
