  "ud3.2:8.1": "The image of the “dove-footed” nymphs is, so far as I know, unique. Doves have bright pink feet, evoking the rouged feet often mentioned as a sign of beauty. But doves in Vedic mythology are emissaries of  Nirṛti, the malign goddess of dissolution. The footprint of a dove in the fireplace is an omen of death (Rig Veda 10.165.4,  Āpastamba Gṛhyasūtra 8.23.9). Perhaps these delightful nymphs are the secret emissaries of Dissolution, their feet betraying the horrifying reality beneath the beguiling surface. "
