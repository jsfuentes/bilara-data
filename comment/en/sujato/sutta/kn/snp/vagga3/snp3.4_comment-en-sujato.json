  "snp3.4:5.3": "The commentary glosses <i lang='pi' translate='no'>māṇavehi</i>, which normally means “brahmin students”, with <i lang='pi' translate='no'>manussehi</i> (“humans”); both words mean “descendant of the first man, Manu”. <i lang='pi' translate='no'>Māṇava</i> is also used in the sense “human” at <a href='https://suttacentral.net/mn130/en/sujato#30.4'>MN 130:30.4</a>.

  "snp3.4:7.3": "The Buddha is demonstrating his expertise. The verse here called Sāvittī (Sanskrit Sāvitrī) may be recited in Gāyatrī or Anuṣṭubh metres. The form specified here is the Gāyatrī, which is the form recommended for the initiation of a student in Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 11.5.4.13 (see also Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 5.14), and probably represents the lineage practiced by Siddhattha under his former teachers.

  "snp3.4:14.2": "The line plays with <i lang='pi' translate='no'>jāti</i> (“birth”), <i lang='pi' translate='no'>jāyati</i> (“give birth”), and <i lang='pi' translate='no'>jātavedas</i>. The latter term is a Vedic word for fire or “flame”. Its meaning is obscure, but I think the sense is <i lang='pi' translate='no'>jāta</i> (“those who have been born”, i.e. “mortals”) plus <i lang='pi' translate='no'>vedas</i> (“knowledge”), i.e. “one who brings knowledge to mortals”. This is the fire-god Agni, who comes down from the sun to the sacrificial fire, bringing light and awareness and Vedic knowledge to those who have been born, namely mortal humans. In this passage, it implies that anyone who “has been born” can “give birth” to “knowledge” regardless of their “birth”. ",
