In the origin story below <i lang='pi' translate='no'>bhesajja</i> seems to refer to the five standard tonics, and I translate it accordingly. The commentary at Sp 2.306 glosses <i lang='pi' translate='no'>bhesajja</i> with <i lang='pi' translate='no'>sappitelādīsu</i>,  “Ghee, oil, etc.”, which lends some  support to this view. In the actual rule, however, the word <i lang='pi' translate='no'>paccaya</i> is used, which may suggest a broader meaning, and I render it accordingly as “requisites”. ",
